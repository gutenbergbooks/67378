<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
THE CATTLE-WHARF AT DEPTFORD
</h3>

<p>
Frederick L. C. Harcourt, Viscount Ratcliff,
was extremely natty in his flannels, buckskins,
and yachting cap, and consequently he aroused
tremendous excitement, plainly being nothing more
or less than a "toff" of the first water.
</p>

<p>
As he strode along the cattle-wharf at Deptford,
he looked as much out of place as would a royal
highness if suddenly dropped among the habitués
of Sally Tucker's pub.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, because of the Royal Yacht Club
insignia on his cap, and also because his face was
very brown and square-chinned and his shoulders
rather broader than most, his "sunfish" prodding
the long-horns down the gangs kept their comments
strictly to themselves.
</p>

<p>
Harcourt, who was strolling along in a rather
aimless fashion, nodded quietly to the astonished
S.P.C.A. inspector, replied to the latter's flurried
greeting that it certainly was a fine day, and passed
on.  His dark-blue eyes settled on an ancient and
dishonorable well-deck cargo tank of some three
thousand tons, from which the last batch of cattle
were being driven into the wharf pens.
</p>

<p>
As he passed down beneath her counter, on the
edge of the wharf, his sauntering ceased rather
abruptly.  From somewhere came a well-directed
stream of blue, evil-smelling, pipe smoke, which
shot down with the wind squarely athwart his
face.
</p>

<p>
Harcourt looked up to see a man, obviously a
"sunfish" or cattle-boat hand, leaning lazily
upon the rail above him and grinning amiably at
the intruder.
</p>

<p>
Foul beyond the ordinary foulness of the bullock
waiter was the man, his clothes a mere mass of
tattered rags, and dirt; but there was a twinkle in
his grey eyes, and his face and neck were brown and
rough and muscled.  His tousle of black hair was
crowned by a battered felt hat, whose brim flapped
at weird angles about his ears; but from brow to
chin his face was aquiline, sharp, while, as he
addressed the other, white teeth flashed on his
pipe-stem.
</p>

<p>
"Slumming, pardner?"
</p>

<p>
Harcourt smiled, his cheeks rosy through their
bronze, and something of the cool insolence that
had rested in the grey eyes above him died away
before his look.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps.  Come down here, my man.  I'd like
a word with you, don't you know."
</p>

<p>
The sunfish did not move, but sent a slow stream
of smoke down the wind, his eyes narrowing
slightly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not your man," came the calm retort.
"Also, I'm quite satisfied where I am.  If you want
a word with me you are at liberty to trot up here;
but I'd advise you to take that white coat off first.
I'm liable to muss it up if you get me too excited."
</p>

<p>
The Englishman stared for a moment, evidently
surprised at the voice and accent of the sunfish,
which held quite as much authority as did his own
and which betrayed culture despite the challenging
veneer of insolence.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the scattered sunfish and cowpunchers
took note of their visitor's stoppage and,
as the last of the cattle were shoved into their
pen, a little crowd collected about the gang,
scenting trouble with unmingled joy.  Seeing that
one of their comrades had taken the burden upon
his own shoulders, they encouraged him distantly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't youse take any lip off'n him, pal!"
</p>

<p>
"Tell the bleedin', bloody toff 'is pants is tore,
'Ammer!"
</p>

<p>
"Ain't his little feet pretty&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The murmuring died away with startling abruptness,
for one of the cow-punchers shouted over from
the pen, with callous indifference to the feelings of
the visitor;
</p>

<p>
"Shut up, you stiffs!  That's his lordship what
laid out the Brighton Blighter last night.  I seen
him do it!"
</p>

<p>
Amid the ensuing silence Harcourt flushed darkly
and walked to the gangway, the men drawing back
suddenly from his mild look.
</p>

<p>
Up above watched the sunfish, his grey eyes
wide, for all the docks had heard the story&mdash;how
the famous Brighton Blighter had encountered
some toff or other in Oxford Street the previous
night, and how, after some passing reference to
lords and ladies, the heavy-weight champion had
been knocked out cold within a minute.
</p>

<p>
So this mild-eyed, wide-shouldered yachtsman
was the man, then!  The sunfish quietly laid aside
his pipe and stood waiting; if his invitation had
been accepted in the spirit in which it had been
issued, he was like to have his work cut out for
him.  Harcourt, however, displayed no bellicose
intention, but halted a few feet away.
</p>

<p>
"Well, now that I am here, I presume you'll
grant me a few moments?"
</p>

<p>
The sunfish grinned as the blue eyes twinkled into his.
</p>

<p>
"I can spare you five minutes, my lord.
I thought that perhaps you desired a sparring
partner!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say now!"  Harcourt flushed again and
was plainly ill at ease.  "Just forget all that bally
rot, can't you?  It's too beastly&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Listen!"
</p>

<p>
The sunfish held up a hand, and from the wharf
below a confused murmur drifted up from the
gathering crowd.
</p>

<p>
"That's 'im, a talkin' to 'Ammer!"
</p>

<p>
"Aw, what youse givin' us?  He didn't knock
out your blamed white hope!"
</p>

<p>
"Stow that, ye flatfoot!  Billy here seen it, an'
that's the guy, all right!"
</p>

<p>
The sunfish grinned again at the uneasy yachtsman.
"Don't be bashful, your lordship&mdash;true
greatness cannot be hidden under flannels, even
at Deptford, you see.  Sorry to receive you in these
duds, but my valet hasn't come down to the dock
as yet."
</p>

<p>
A flicker of something that was not amusement
flared out in the blue eyes, but it passed quickly
with a chuckle.
</p>

<p>
"All right, my friend&mdash;you're the man I'm
looking for!  But, upon my word, I hardly expected
such good luck."
</p>

<p>
"It's all yours so far," came the dry retort.
"Only, if you're looking for a thug, you'll find
plenty down there in the crowd."  His grey eyes
rested shrewdly, but laughingly, on the other.
</p>

<p>
"No, thanks very much."  An appraising glance
and a nod accompanied the words.  "You'll do.
Your name is Hammer I take it.  American?"
</p>

<p>
"Stars and stripes, you bet.  As to Hammer,
that's not my name, but it's handle enough for this
craft.  'Ammer, 'ammer, 'ammer on the 'ard
'ighway, you know&mdash;only my cognomen is a title of
distinction gained by the honest use of fists.
Yours, if you have one, was probably gained through
the chance of birth.  I will say, though, that you're
very decent-looking, for a Britisher."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thanks very much!"  The visitor seemed
anything but angry, to the visible disappointment
of the watching gangway; still, he very plainly was
bewildered by the cultured tones of the sunfish.
"Are you&mdash;er&mdash;looking for work?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, that depends on the work," returned
Hammer easily, paying no heed to the outraged
ship's officers, who were looking on aghast.  "No
yachting, thanks.  Too hard to look pleasant all
the time.  Besides, I can't keep straight."
</p>

<p>
The other's eyes met his, unsurprised, questioning,
and beneath that level gaze Hammer only
kept up his truculent air with an effort.  This
Englishman was very likeable.
</p>

<p>
"How so, Mr. Hammer?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, general cussedness and particular booze.
Better browse along and hunt up another victim,
your lordship!  I like your looks, but I don't like
my own&mdash;in comparison."
</p>

<p>
This rather impulsive admission had no effect
on Harcourt beyond sending a stubborn glint into
his blue eyes.  Deliberately pausing to light a
cigarette, he extended his case to the other;
Hammer refused, replacing his pipe in his mouth,
but this time he carefully sent the smoke downward.
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm rather keen on you, Hammer.  I've
been&mdash;er&mdash;browsing along, as you say, all of the
morning without any success, and it's getting
tiresome.  As matter of fact, I came out to look for a
man with a second officer's ticket, a man who could
use his fists and who was willing to take a chance
with me.
</p>

<p>
"Now, however, I've changed my mind.  I'm
not quite sure yet as to what offer I'll make you,
but come up to my address in the city when you're
through here&mdash;to-night, if you can.  Here's my
card and a tenner to act as retainer."
</p>

<p>
The astonished Hammer mechanically shoved
the Bank of England note into some recess of his
ragged shirt, then perused the card.  He looked up
with hesitation in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Mind, Harcourt, I've warned you that I'm
no good&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!  If I was after a sober, respectable
seaman, do you think I'd have come here looking
for one?  When can I expect to see you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, have it your own way, then!"  Hammer
shrugged his shoulders, resignedly.  "I'll meet you
say, at Prince's for dinner.  Centre table, far end."
</p>

<p>
"Eh?"  Harcourt's eyes opened.  "You&mdash;er&mdash;but
Prince's, don't you know&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;&mdash;Doesn't go with these duds, you mean?"  Hammer
chuckled as he finished the other's hesitating
sentence.  "Never mind&mdash;you should worry,
Harcourt!  Much obliged for the tenner, just the
same; all you have to do is to show up and see what
you find.  Seven-thirty suit you?"
</p>

<p>
"Very well, thanks," murmured Harcourt, and
so the colloquy ended&mdash;in amused and rather
interested toleration on the part of the sunfish,
and in bewildered doubt on that of the Englishman.
</p>

<p>
At seven-thirty that evening Harcourt received
another shock, and this time a greater one.  For
after he stepped into the big dining-room at Prince's
and beckoned the stately head-waiter, that individual
arrived with the calm information that Mr. Hammer
was waiting.
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;you know Mr. Hammer, Bucks?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite well, sir," responded Bucks, and Harcourt
followed in subdued amazement.
</p>

<p>
He was led to a table, from which a man in
evening dress sprang to meet him, hand extended.
For a moment the sorely-doubting Englishman
did not recognize the sunfish, until he took in the
hard grey eyes, the tanned features, the keen
incisive lines of the face.
</p>

<p>
Then he recovered himself and went through the
form of greeting stiffly; but Hammer had no
intention of letting him off so easily.
</p>

<p>
"It was rather a low-down trick, wasn't it?"
grinned the American cheerfully.  "However, we'll
have an explanation all around.  Poor chap,
your face was a picture this morning when I
announced that we'd dine here!"
</p>

<p>
"I must apologize, of course, my dear chap,"
returned Harcourt ruefully; then, unable to resist
the infectious humour of the other, he broke into
a laugh and the incident was closed.
</p>

<p>
In truth, Cyrus Hammer was well calculated to
draw a second glance, for not only did his evening
clothes fit him impeccably, but he wore them with
ease and grace which made him to the full as
<i>distingué</i> as his aristocratic companion.
</p>

<p>
His mouth was hard, and there were lines in
his face which has no place in the face of a man of
twenty-eight who had lived his life well; but these
were in great part redeemed by an abundance of
unfailing good humour, which hid, mask-like, the
hard-fisted quality of the man underneath.
</p>

<p>
Harcourt wasted no time, and no sooner was the
dinner fairly begun than he plunged headlong into
the subject under discussion.
</p>

<p>
"Hammer, I have a little surprise for you myself,
perhaps.  I told you this morning that I had
changed my plans pending your acceptance of my
offer to you, so there is no use in beating about
the bush.
</p>

<p>
"Until a month ago I had considered myself
fairly well fixed for life; then came that flurry
in Wall Street which wrecked two of your big
institutions.
</p>

<p>
"I woke up one morning to find myself almost a
beggar, as all my funds were invested in American
securities and they had slipped down and out with
a crash.  My word, it was a blow!  I had a few
hundreds left; no more."
</p>

<p>
Hammer displayed none of the surprise he felt
at this astounding revelation, but merely nodded;
and after a moment, the other continued:
</p>

<p>
"Practically all that I saved out of the crash
was my yacht, the <i>Daphne</i>.  All my family have
been sailors, don't you know, and if I hadn't been,
sent down from the 'Mill'&mdash;Woolwich&mdash;years ago,
I'd have been in the navy to-day.  In fact, one of
my proudest possessions is a Board of Trade
certificate as Master.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'd about made up my mind to sell the
craft and try my luck in your bally country, when
along comes an offer to charter the yacht.  That
gave me the idea.  I say, Hammer, why couldn't
I take this party out to East Africa, where they
wish to go, then&mdash;er&mdash;browse around the ocean,
acting as my own captain?  Couldn't a chap make
a decent living at that, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Ought to," chuckled Hammer, making no
secret of his interest by this time.  "If you're willing
to take a bit of risk once in a while, I fancy you
could pick up some easy coin, and have a good time
as well.  But why should this party want to charter
a yacht to reach East Africa with?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's that big Dresden archaeological chap,
Dr. Sigurd Krausz&mdash;he's sending out an expedition
to dig up some beastly thing or other, and wants
the <i>Daphne</i> for his own use, the field force going
separately.  I've not the slightest idea what he's
after, but he's willing to pay well, and seems to be
doing the thing on his own hook instead of working
for any museum.
</p>

<p>
"But let's get down to business, Hammer.
I've been thinking this over, and since I am frankly
down and out, as you Americans would say, I've
no notion of depending on myself alone.  I'm a
pretty good character-reader, Hammer, and I
liked you at first sight or I wouldn't make this
offer.  Other things being equal, how would you
like to take a junior partnership in the <i>Daphne</i>?"
</p>

<p>
Hammer looked at him silently, wondering if
the man meant what he said.  But the other was
plainly in earnest, and, moreover, Hammer thought
that he had seldom met a man to whom he was so
attracted.  That the liking was mutual there seemed
to be no doubt; but would it last?
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," he returned slowly.  "I'm no
sailor, for one thing&mdash;I'm a cattle-boat hand, and
nothing else.  I can't see where I'd be any good."
</p>

<p>
"No matter," declared Harcourt impatiently.
"You could soon pick up navigation; for that
matter, there are plenty of men in command of
craft without proper license.  However, I'm not
figuring on you as a sailor.  I can do that, but I
don't know a bally thing about business.  You
could handle the business end of everything and
gradually work into handling the ship; she'd
be my property, of course, but we'd share even on
what we made."
</p>

<p>
"Go slow now," and Hammer laughed quietly
while the waiter hovered about them.  Then,
when they were once more alone, he went on:
"Better let me spin you my yarn first, then see
how far you'd be willing to trust me."
</p>

<p>
Hammer's real name was Cyrus Murray, and
until three years before this time he had been
engaged in a profitable brokerage business in New
York City.  Alone in the world, he had made his
own way, and in the course of its making he had
contracted a hasty and ill-advised marriage with a
girl who was in no way fitted to be his wife.
</p>

<p>
It was a sordid little tragedy, by no means
uncommon in American life of to-day; but,
unfortunately for Murray, his wife had been the
first to discover that it was a tragedy.
</p>

<p>
He glossed over this portion of the tale in its
telling, merely stating that he had allowed her to
obtain a divorce, and had turned over to her the
greater part of his worldly goods; but he had been
hard hit by the entire affair.
</p>

<p>
Impulsively, he had thrown his business
overboard, and one night, in reckless desperation,
he sought shelter from his thoughts by shipping
aboard a cattle-boat.  Curiously enough, before
he reached Liverpool he had found that in spite of
the terribly rough life, in spite of the almost daily
battles for existence into which his very appearance
and manner flung him, the hard physical labour
and the tortured weariness of his body was a relief
to his mind.  Then the liquor.
</p>

<p>
So for three years he had been traversing the
Atlantic, working hard, fighting hard, drinking
hard; his ambition was destroying; he took
savage zest in bullying the thugs and degenerates
who were his companions in misfortune, and he had
thought himself fairly content at the level to which
he had sunk.
</p>

<p>
Upon each arrival in England he made a practise
of going to London and living like a gentleman for
a week or two&mdash;for he had still some money left&mdash;until
the life became unbearable to him, and back
he would go to his cattle-boats and human cattle.
</p>

<p>
"There's the whole thing," he concluded with a
bitter smile.  "A fool paying for his folly, that's
all.  Still want me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," came the quiet answer.  "I think we're
well mated, Hammer; but, to make sure, suppose
we make this a trial cruise together.  You'll never
find any ambition aboard a bally cattle-boat,
that's sure, and you might better go to hell decently,
if you're bound to go.
</p>

<p>
"However, you're a real man, and I like you.
My offer stands; only, don't you know, I want your
word that you won't drink while you're with
me.  I mean&mdash;er&mdash;well, drinking in a beastly
fashion&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I get you, old man," chuckled Hammer quickly.
"Suppose we put it that I can drink as much as you
do, but no more, eh?  All right, then&mdash;but I've
really no great inclination for drink in itself.  You
have my word of honour, such as it is&mdash;and here's a
toast in coffee to the <i>Daphne</i> and the daffy Dutchman!"
</p>

<p>
"Done!" cried Harcourt in undisguised delight,
but as he raised his cup Bucks approached with a
whispered word and a card.  Harcourt frowned,
glancing at the latter.
</p>

<p>
"'John Solomon'&mdash;who the devil is John Solomon?
Who is he, Bucks?"
</p>

<p>
"A rather queer <i>person</i>, sir," replied the head-waiter
sagely.  "I might let him wait in a private
room, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"All right, do so.  We'll be out in a
moment&mdash;confounded nuisance!  How did the fellow come to
look me up here?  By Jove, Hammer, the
unmitigated insolence of some&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Cool off," laughed the American.  "Here,
have another cigarette before we go, and we can
investigate your friend after we finish.  Funny
name, John Solomon!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
JOHN SOLOMON
</h3>

<p>
Since Hammer had an inveterate dislike of fat
men in general, and blue-eyed fat men in
particular&mdash;born out of his experience with a fat and
demented Swede cook on his first cattle-boat trip&mdash;it
was not to be wondered at that he eyed John
Solomon with no great favour in his heart.  For
John Solomon was fat and blue-eyed.
</p>

<p>
"Pudgy" would be a better word than the flat
and misleading "fat".  Pudgy embraces the face
that a man is not merely fat, but that he is filled
to a comfortable completeness, as it were; that he
is not too fat to move about, but just enough so to
be dignified on occasion; and that his expression is
cheerful above all else.
</p>

<p>
Save for this last item, the description fitted
John Solomon to a dot, for while his face was
cheerful enough, it was as totally devoid of
expression as a face can be&mdash;and still remain a face.
</p>

<p>
He was a short, little man, not more than five
feet six, very decently dressed in blue serge, and he
sat quite contentedly filling a short clay pipe from
a whittled plug as Hammer and Harcourt entered
the private room.
</p>

<p>
When he glanced up and rose to meet them, the
first thing Hammer noticed was that healthy-looking
yet expressionless face, from which gazed
out two eyes of pale blue and of great size.
</p>

<p>
As he came to learn later, Nature had endowed
John Solomon with absolutely stolid features,
but in compensation had given him eyes which could
be rendered unusually intelligent at times.
</p>

<p>
"You are John Solomon?" questioned Harcourt
curtly.  "What is your business with me, and how
did you know I was here?"
</p>

<p>
"Beggin' your pardon, sir," and the pale-blue
eyes met the darker ones of Harcourt without
shrinking.  "I 'ave a pal down at Deptford who
'appens to 'ear what you and Mr. 'Ammer said this
morning.  'E knowed I was werry anxious for a
ship, and 'e comes to me with it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you want a ship, then?" returned Harcourt.
"And therefore you interrupt a gentleman at dinner
in a fashionable restaurant&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't mean no 'arm, sir," broke in Solomon,
without cringing, however.  "You see, sir, I
'adn't no means o' knowing where to find you
otherwise.  I say that if so be as a man wants work,
it don't matter 'ow 'e gets it, so 'e gets it, and I
trust as 'ow you'd look at it the same way,
Mr. Harcourt, sir."
</p>

<p>
"And quite right you are, John Solomon,"
exclaimed Hammer, amused despite himself, and
beginning to think that this pudgy little man had
some brains.  Since Harcourt was not quite sure
whether to be angry or not, the American's laugh
saved the situation for the moment.  "You're got
plenty of nerve, my friend, but you must want work
pretty badly to go after it so strong.  What's your
line&mdash;seaman?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," and the wide blue eyes rested in child-like
faith on Hammer's face.  "I'm a bit 'eavy for
that there, sir, though I've A.B. papers.  No sir,
though I can do a bit o' navigation at a pinch, I'd
feel more at 'ome like wi' figures.  I writes a good
'and, sir, and I knows 'ow to 'andle port off'cers
and such.  If so be as you could use a supercargo,
sir?"
</p>

<p>
Hammer turned to the Englishman, who was
still eyeing Solomon doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"How are we fixed for officers, anyway, Harcourt?
I've got a grudge against fat men as a rule, but
hanged if I don't admire this chap's nerve!  A
man who'll butt into a place like this to get a job
must have something in him."
</p>

<p>
Harcourt rubbed his chin reflectively.  "Well,
the yacht has been laid up for six months and didn't
have any crew, so Krausz agreed to place a dozen
of his own men aboard her under a mate, if I'd
find a chief officer and an engine-room crew.
</p>

<p>
"So far as standing watches is concerned, you
can rank as first mate, unofficially, and I've already
arranged for my old chief engineer to pick up his
own men.
</p>

<p>
"A supercargo isn't absolutely essential, but
Krausz is going to take a lot of stuff out to do
his excavating with, as well as packing cases and
all that bally impedimenta&mdash;my word, Hammer,
I don't just know what to say!"
</p>

<p>
"Beggin' your pardon, sir," put in Solomon,
as the other paused, "but I can take care o' port
papers and such werry well, and 'ave A1 references.
A supercargo ain't no use unless 'e's a lot o' use,
I says, sir, and I goes on that princ'ple.  What's
more, Mr. 'Ammer, I knows a man as can fix
you up wi' first off'cer's papers for a matter o'
two pun and no questions asked."
</p>

<p>
The twinkle in the blue eyes drew an answering
chuckle from the American, even Harcourt relaxing
sufficiently to smile slightly.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to have your uses, certainly," said
the Englishman dryly.  "By the way, Hammer,
where are you stopping?"
</p>

<p>
"I've stopped," grinned the American cheerfully.
"My war-bag's aboard the ship still, but
there's nothing in it worth carrying off.  I have
my pipe here, and no other clothes worthy the
name.
</p>

<p>
"Then you'd better go home with me to-night,"
returned the other.  "We'll do the opera first,
if you like.  To-morrow, you can take up your
quarters aboard the <i>Daphne</i>, and we can talk
over money matters at leisure.
</p>

<p>
"Now, John Solomon, you seem to have a
fairly good idea of my business already, so I'll
simply say that my yacht, the <i>Daphne</i>, is anchored
at the Royal Thames docks and that you can go
aboard whenever you please.  As supercargo, you
will join the officers' mess, of course, but I'll
be aboard to-morrow and will fix things up with
you, and you can sign articles then.  And&mdash;er&mdash;about
those bally papers&mdash;er&mdash;you had better
get them."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, I'll 'ave them to-morrow, sir," and
John Solomon touched his forehead respectfully;
but Hammer imagined that he caught something
very like a wink from one of those wide blue
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you werry much, Mr. Harcourt, and
you, Mr. 'Ammer, and I'll be aboard bright and
early, since it's the early worm what sees the
bird first, as the Good Book says."
</p>

<p>
"Very good," rejoined Harcourt briefly, and
so John Solomon passed forth from all the glory
of Prince's, with his little black clay pipe wagging
defiantly at the liveried doormen, and the place
thereof knew him no more.
</p>

<p>
Although he had accepted the proffered partnership
glibly enough, Hammer was by no means
sure that he would stick to it, for various reasons.
Chief among these was the fact that he had a
profound distrust of himself; since he had
deliberately thrown himself to the dogs, in a way,
he had come to have a deep-rooted conviction that
he was no good, that his better qualities
mere surface outcroppings, and that a man such
as Harcourt would like him less the better he
knew him.
</p>

<p>
Still, he frankly liked Harcourt, and the idea
of free-lancing about the ocean appealed strongly
to him.  But he had so long been battering down
the better side of his own nature, the shock of
his past trouble had so deeply bitten into his
soul, that he could not look forward to the future
with anything approaching hope.
</p>

<p>
His very promise to abstain from drink had
been made solely because that was the only way
in which he could accept Harcourt's offer, and not
from any desire to regain his lost state.
</p>

<p>
"No," he told himself that night, alone in
his room at Harcourt's apartments, "I guess I'm
a wastrel, pure and simple.  I've nothing to go
ahead for, and I've got a devil of a lot to forget;
if I can only get up enough interest in the yacht
and in the places we visit and the work we do,
then there's a chance that I can break even and
stay decent for a while.  And, Lord knows, it's
about time!"
</p>

<p>
In which conclusion he was undeniably correct,
much more so than in his foregoing premises.
For Hammer was not nearly so unlikeable as he
imagined; in the effort to cast his old life and
his youthful mistakes far behind him he had
plunged into the swiftest maelstrom he could find,
as better men than he have done and will do,
but he had managed to keep his head above
water&mdash;much to his own surprise.
</p>

<p>
The good-humoured manner, which was at
first an assumption to hide the hurts beneath,
had finally become reality, and perhaps Harcourt
had shrewdly reckoned on the fact that mental
trouble is very likely to lessen and vanish beneath
the light of friendship.
</p>

<p>
Harcourt himself was little bothered over his
own financial crash.  Accustomed to thinking little
of money or its value, he did not trouble greatly
about making his living now that his plans for
the immediate future were settled.  He was twenty-six,
two years younger than the American, but
he had taken the <i>Daphne</i> far around the seven
seas, and in some ways was a good deal older
than Hammer.
</p>

<p>
The following day, having procured other clothes
than his dress-suit, Hammer went aboard the
<i>Daphne</i>.  She was a small but luxuriously furnished
steam-yacht of a thousand tons burden, and having
been already overhauled for the benefit of
Dr. Krausz, was ready for sea, save for stores and
crew; also, the archaeologist's "impedimenta", as
Harcourt had termed it, had not yet come aboard.
Hammer was delighted with her, and with Harcourt
and John Solomon, put in a busy day.
</p>

<p>
Harcourt was well satisfied with his supercargo,
for Solomon took charge of the purchasing
of the stores, and not only procured them of
excellent quality, but at an astonishingly low
price.
</p>

<p>
He proved to have a thorough acquaintance
with his duties, and also with the duties of the
other officers, and promised to be on the whole
an exceedingly useful man.
</p>

<p>
Nothing was seen of Dr. Sigurd Krausz during
the next two days, but Hammer learned that the
point of the expedition was a small bay near
Melindi, on the East African coast, and that
another part of the expedition was being sent
ahead to make the preliminary excavations.
</p>

<p>
On the third morning Harcourt sent the American
to Krausz's hotel to inform the professor that
the yacht was ready for her lading and passengers,
and now, for the first time, as a result of that
sending, Cyrus Hammer found himself awakening
to the fact that he had been suddenly transplanted
into a group of peculiar individuals, from the
aristocratic but "busted" viscount and the pudgy
John Solomon to the unscientific-appearing scientist,
and that there was a screw loose somewhere.
</p>

<p>
This was the manner of it.  Being now in
possession of his firstmate's certificate&mdash;"and
no questions asked"&mdash;Hammer sent in his name
and was admitted to the presence of the already-famous
archaeologist.  For Sigurd Krausz was not
after the pattern Hammer had anticipated.
</p>

<p>
He was a rather thick-set man, clad only in
pyjamas, and was at work over a desk full of papers.
These he abandoned to greet Hammer, pulling
the latter aside to the window as if to keep him
away from the desk.
</p>

<p>
Then, through his host's <i>négligé</i> attire, Hammer
saw that Krausz was a mass of muscles; his hand-grip
was like iron, and his large head was set well
back between his shoulders in a fashion which
made him greet the world with out-flung jaw.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing very remarkable about the
man's face, which was Saxon rather than Teutonic,
save for the heavy-lidded eyes.  The features
were regular, of massive mould, and the ridge
denoting the thinker overhung the eyes; but&mdash;and
this Hammer did not observe at once&mdash;-the
right temple was crossed by a nervous muscle,
which throbbed like a ribbon underneath the
skin.
</p>

<p>
On the whole, Hammer liked the scientist,
deciding that while his face could be cruel upon
occasion, it was the face of a strong man.
</p>

<p>
"I am very glad to see you, Mr. Hammer,"
exclaimed Krausz cordially, on learning the
American's errand.  He seemed in no hurry to
return to his papers, but pressed Hammer into a
chair and questioned him closely about the yacht,
puffing the while at a long black panetela.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to his recent labours, Hammer survived
the examination in good shape, and his personality
seemed to make some impression on the German.
</p>

<p>
"I like you, yess, friend Hammer," remarked
the latter, handing him one of the thin panetelas.
"Also, I like Mr. Harcourt, and trust we will
get on well together.  You are American, yess?
I like Americans, but not the British, for sailors.
That iss why I am putting some of my own men
aboard, for they will also serve as helpers in the
work.  You are interested in archaeology, yess?"
</p>

<p>
"Not in general," returned Hammer frankly.
"However, I didn't know there was anything
to be dug up on the east coast of Africa."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, plenty, plenty!" puffed the other, and
after a long puff continued: "It iss some relics
of Portuguese rule in Mombasa which I hope to
find&mdash;relics more important ass ethnological and
historic things than for their intrinsic value."
</p>

<p>
"By the way, I'd like to know just how many
are in your party, doctor.  Our steward wants
to get the cabins in shape."
</p>

<p>
"My party?  <i>Nein</i>, there will be but myself
and my secretary going out.  Professor Helmuth
my assistant, leaves to-day for Mombasa to get
things started, and coming back we will perhaps
crowd the ship, yess.
</p>

<p>
"My second mate, Hans Schlak, will bring the
men aboard to-morrow; if our necessary permits,
and so on, arrive from the British Colonial Office,
we will leave the day after.  They should be here
already.  That iss satisfactory?"
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly&mdash;" began Hammer, when a third
voice interrupted apologetically.
</p>

<p>
"In half an hour the <i>Mombasa</i> sails, Herr
Doctor!"
</p>

<p>
Krausz turned with an exclamation.  Shuffling
out from a shadowed corner of the room, Hammer
saw a black-clad, small, flat-chested man, with
deep-set, furtive eyes, high brow, and retreating
chin; the chin did not express weakness altogether,
for it was rather the fox chin, which denotes
cunning and ability.  The doctor waved a hand.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hammer, my secretary, Adolf Jenson.
Very good, Adolf; better take a taxi and deliver
the papers in person.  Remember, Professor Sara
L. Helmuth, stateroom 12 B."
</p>

<p>
With this he turned to the desk and picked up
a small black rubber wallet, which Jenson took with
something very like a cringe, departing with an
inaudible murmur of words.
</p>

<p>
Somewhat disgusted with the man, Hammer
followed him, once more gripping the firm hand
of Krausz and taking with him the remembrance
of cordial words and an effusive smile from the
big scientist.
</p>

<p>
The American stopped in the hotel entrance
to light the doctor's cigar, and, as he glanced
over his cupped hands, he saw something that
astonished him.  For there, just at the curb,
and beckoning frantically to the nearest taxi,
was no less a person than his supercargo, honest
John Solomon!
</p>

<p>
Hammer stared in disbelief of his own eyes,
since Solomon was at that moment supposed to
be laying in a supply of extra cabin stores on the
other side of the city.
</p>

<p>
But there was no mistake; even as the taxi
drew up Solomon turned and waved his cap at
some unseen individual farther up the street, then
scrambled headfirst into the machine, his hurried
words floating back to Hammer:
</p>

<p>
"P. and O. docks&mdash;the <i>Mombasa</i>!  And 'urry
or no tip!"
</p>

<p>
The taxi darted away, Hammer staring after
it dazedly.  What on earth could this mean?
Why was this fat little Cockney supercargo of
his chasing in a taxi-cab after a P. and O. liner
due to sail in half an hour?  Could it have any
connection with the errand of the secretary, Adolf
Jenson?
</p>

<p>
A flood of questions darted through Hammer's
brain on the instant, and, giving way to the
impulse, he sprang to the taxi which had drawn
up to the curb in place of that taken by Solomon.
Whatever the supercargo's purpose might be,
Hammer determined to get down to the dock before
the liner sailed and see what was going on, if
possible.  It might be a wild-goose chase, but
on the other hand&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"P. and O. docks&mdash;I want to see the <i>Mombasa</i> go
out, and she leaves in twenty minutes.  Do it
on the jump!"
</p>

<p>
The chauffeur grinned, and slammed the door.
A moment later they were driving through the
streets at a good speed, the American still pondering
this surprising action of his harmless-looking little
supercargo.
</p>

<p>
And Solomon had actually been talking of tips,
when only a couple of days before he had dared
much in order to capture a job!  The whole affair
was perplexing in the extreme.
</p>

<p>
"I never did like fat men, anyhow," reflected
Hammer grimly.  "That chap seemed to know
a whole lot the first night we met, and I'll bet
that he isn't the fool he looks by a long shot.
But whatever got him mixed up with this Krausz
business&mdash;if he is mixed up in it?  I may be barking
up the wrong tree, of course, and everything may
be all right, so I'd better go slow if I catch him."
</p>

<p>
The conviction grew upon him during the
remainder of his ride that he would have done
much better to have waited, and to have questioned
Solomon upon returning to the yacht.
</p>

<p>
The man might have friends leaving on the
liner&mdash;but Hammer forgot his vague reasonings
when the taxi drew up suddenly and he found
the entrance to the docks of the Peninsula and
Oriental just ahead.
</p>

<p>
The chauffeur had done his work well, for the
journey had taken just fifteen minutes.  Hammer
found the dock gates open and pushed his way
through the crowd; as he did so he passed the
black-clad figure of Adolf Jenson.
</p>

<p>
But the meek little secretary did not look up,
vanishing toward the gates; and the American
glanced around for John Solomon in vain.
</p>

<p>
There was no trace of him in the crowd, and
the ship had already been cleared of visitors.
The waiting tenders had their lines out, and as
Hammer gazed up the gang-plank was just being
taken in.
</p>

<p>
The whistle crashed out, drowning the tinkle of
bells, and at the same instant Hammer saw an
officer walk hastily to the open gangway,
accompanied by a small pudgy man, dressed in blue.
</p>

<p>
They stood talking together for an instant, then
shook hands; the siren shrilled forth, and wharf-lines
were cast off, and John Solomon leaped
ashore with amazing agility, and was lost in the
crowd.
</p>

<p>
Standing watching in sore perplexity, Hammer
recalled the name of the scientist's
assistant&mdash;"Professor Sara L. Helmuth".  He turned and
pushed back to his waiting taxicab, execrating
his useless trip, for he was now convinced that
it had been useless.
</p>

<p>
"I seem fated to get mixed up with people I
don't like," he smiled to himself, as he was being
driven back to the city, the Royal Thames docks
being up-river.  "First it's a blue-eyed fat man,
and then it's a woman relic-hunter, to say nothing
of that swine of a secretary.  Sara L. Helmuth&mdash;gosh,
what a name!  I never did know a woman
named Sara that was worth a darn for looks."
</p>

<p>
With which conclusion he paid off his chauffeur
and walked the remainder of the distance in an
irritable humour enough.  This humour was by
no means lessened when he saw John Solomon
standing at the gangway, checking off some stores
that were coming aboard, while a number of
heavily-loaded wagons stood waiting by the foredeck,
where a steam winch was getting into action and
stevedores were bustling about.
</p>

<p>
"What's all this?" he demanded bluntly.  "I
thought you were in the city."
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," returned Solomon, not looking up.
"I did take a bit of a run up, sir; but them 'ere
wagons were a bringing of our lading, so I 'urried
back.  Werry fine day, sir."
</p>

<p>
Hammer grunted.  "Tell the steward that there
will only be two passengers.  Dr. Krausz and his
secretary.  The crew will be aboard to-night or
in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"Werry good, sir."
</p>

<p>
Solomon went calmly on with his lists while
the extra cabin stores were brought up the gangway.
Suddenly, as one of the trucks stopped for
checking off, a case of tinned goods joggled over,
and Solomon leaned forward, catching it before
it fell.
</p>

<p>
The action flung his short blue coat up around
his waist, and Hammer caught a glimpse of a
black rubber wallet protruding from the man's
hip-pocket.  He recognized it instantly; it was
the same wallet which Krausz had sent aboard
the <i>Mombasa</i> an hour previously!
</p>

<p>
The American leaned quickly forward and
snatched the wallet away.  Solomon, having
replaced the case, straightened up and whirled,
and Hammer met his wide blue stare with a
smile.
</p>

<p>
"You nearly lost this," he said coolly.  "Nothing
very valuable, I hope?"
</p>

<p>
Solomon's eyes widened a trifle.
</p>

<p>
"Lud, no, sir!  Nothing more wallyble than
my 'baccy, sir.  If so be as a man likes 'baccy
I says, then it's place ain't in a dirty pocket,
but in a neat like pouch, says I.  Werry kind o'
you to save it for me, sir."
</p>

<p>
Ignoring the outstretched hand, Hammer opened
the wallet, determined to test the truth of Solomon's
explanation.  He was convinced that this same
black rubber pouch had contained the papers
sent by Krausz to Professor Sara L. Helmuth,
and that Solomon had, in some way, obtained
them from the latter, or else from the meek secretary.
</p>

<p>
But his growing anger evaporated suddenly
when the opened wallet showed nothing more than
a vile-smelling flat plug of very black,
molasses-impregnated tobacco.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a good pouch, that," he said quietly,
closing it up and handing it back to its owner,
his face inscrutable.  "Is Mr. Harcourt about?"
</p>

<p>
"In the saloon cabin, sir," and, nodding, the
American went on board.
</p>

<p>
He looked back once and saw Solomon mopping
his brow; for some reason the action seemed
significant of relief on the part of the supercargo,
and Hammer frowned.
</p>

<p>
"Confound it, I'd like to know a few things!"
he muttered savagely.  "I'll have a run-in with
that fellow yet!  Wish I hadn't stood up for him
the other night at Prince's; I should have let
Harcourt kick him out, and a good job."
</p>

<p>
And the events which were to follow kept the
regret keen in his mind.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
THE ROAD TO MELINDI
</h3>

<p>
"Well, the beggar was jabbering Arabic with
those three men behind the ventilator this morning,
and his actions don't look good to me, Harcourt.
Oh, you can laugh, and be hanged to you!  I
tell you that John Solomon has more brains than
his position warrants, and that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nonsense, old chap!  Don't be so beastly
suspicious; Solomon told me at Port Said that he
knew a smattering of Arabic, and he's been
tremendously handy.  I say, look at those hills,
eh?"
</p>

<p>
Hammer relapsed into sulky silence, and
presently Harcourt left the bridge to him and
sought his cabin, while the American remained
staring moodily at the purplish-blue Jeb el Geneffeh
hills to the south-west, for the <i>Daphne</i> was passing
through the Bitter Lakes, midway of the Suez
Canal.
</p>

<p>
Until reaching Port Said, the cruise had been
perfect in every way, and his half-realized suspicions
of John Solomon had completely fallen into
abeyance.
</p>

<p>
As Harcourt said, the man had proved to be
very useful, indeed; he seemed to have a perfect
knowledge of port regulations everywhere; he
attended to customs and <i>pratique</i> expeditiously,
and almost made himself indispensable at mess,
with his unfailing good humour and occasional
fragments of home-made philosophy.
</p>

<p>
In fact, he seemed to have taken a liking to
Hammer, and the American had begun to reciprocate
it&mdash;until Port Said.
</p>

<p>
Here, barely an hour before they left for Suez,
word was brought aboard that three of the German
crew were in the hands of the Sudanese police.
Dr. Krausz, who, with his secretary, had not left
his cabin a dozen times during the cruise, went
ashore with Harcourt in furious excitement, but
returned considerably subdued.
</p>

<p>
It seemed that the three men had fallen foul
of some French and Arabs in the native quarter,
that a row had arisen, and one of the French
had been stabbed.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, there was nothing to be done
save to place the matter in the hands of the German
Consul and go on, since Krausz did not wish to
be detained pending the case.
</p>

<p>
As another of the crew was down with eye-trouble
and ought to be left behind in hospital
John Solomon had offered to pick up three or
four natives who could make themselves generally
useful, and after some hesitation, Krausz accepted,
and the supercargo had promptly got his four
Arabs aboard.
</p>

<p>
When, the next morning, Hammer had found
Solomon talking Arabic with three of them in
shelter of a ventilator, he had at once laid the
affair of the black wallet before Harcourt, all
his suspicions aroused.
</p>

<p>
But the Englishman laughed him down, and
even Hammer had to admit that there was nothing
very terrible about the pudgy little man.  So
while the <i>Daphne</i> pursued her course through
the sandy wastes to Port Ibrahim and Suez, Cyrus
Hammer gradually threw off his almost groundless
suspicions and took on his usual good-humoured
manner once more.
</p>

<p>
Hans Schlak, the second mate, was a big
blond German&mdash;a Viking in appearance, slow
and stolid, but thoroughly efficient in every way.
</p>

<p>
The men, too, were smart and well-behaved,
responding so well to Harcourt's discipline that
Hammer was not surprised to find that most of
them had served in the German navy.
</p>

<p>
Beyond discharging her pilot and sending some
letters ashore for the doctor, the <i>Daphne</i> made
no stop at Port Ibrahim, and by next morning
she was well on her way out of the gulf and down
the Red Sea.
</p>

<p>
They were holding in somewhat to the Arabian
coast, and Hammer, in charge of the bridge,
was seated in the chart-house going over a lesson
in navigation, when a figure darkened the doorway
and John Solomon entered.
</p>

<p>
"Beggin' your pardon, Mr. 'Ammer, sir, but
would you 'ave the kindness to let me take a
bit of a look through the glass?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know that it would do any great
harm," replied Hammer cheerfully.  "Help
yourself, Solomon.  Want to get a last look at
Asia, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," came the sober answer, as Solomon
procured a pair of binoculars.  "You see, sir,
I was down this 'ere way a few months ago.  Werry
interesting place, Mr. 'Ammer, and when so be
as you finds an interesting place, I says&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The rest was lost as Solomon directed a fixed
gaze from the port doorway toward the distant
coast, and he did not change his attitude for five
minutes.  Hammer watched him with some interest,
until at length the other lowered the glasses with
a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Lud, what a bare coast she is, sir!  If I might
make so bold, sir, what be we a going to do after
we reach Mombasa?"
</p>

<p>
"Why," smiled Hammer, "we're bound for
a little harbour up the coast called Melindi.  We'll
have to leave the yacht at Kilindini harbour,
after the trip up, and go to and from Melindi
by launch, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, sir; it's a werry bad place indeed, Melindi.
And may I ask, sir, if so be as we're a-going to
stay with the yacht or go with Dr. Krausz?"
</p>

<p>
"Not decided yet, Solomon, to my knowledge.
Why, do you want to go along with the relic-hunters?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, though I'm werry interested in strange
things.  Beggin' your pardon, sir, Dr. Krausz
is all werry well in his way, but 'is way ain't
to me notion."
</p>

<p>
"So you don't like him?  That's queer!"  Hammer
pulled out his pipe, and, accepting this
as tacit permission, Solomon began to whittle
at a plug which he had been holding ready.
</p>

<p>
The wide blue eyes came up and met his squarely,
with just the suspicion of a frown hovering at
their edges.  Hammer decided that his supercargo
might yet inveigle some expression into his
face if he kept on in this way.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir; me 'umble opinion is that Dutchmen
ain't to be trusted, not so far away from 'ome;
and I've 'ad some experience.  Do you think,
sir, as 'ow Mr. Harcourt would give me a
discharge at Mombasa?  O' course, I signed on
for the voyage, sir, but I 'ave me reasons for
wantin' to be stopping off at Mombasa, so I comes
to you all square and above-board.  If you want
a thing, why, ask for it ship-shape, as the Good
Book says, sir.  That's what I 'old to."
</p>

<p>
"Right," nodded Hammer.  He was no little
surprised at the request; but as it would have
been easy enough to slip the yacht at Mombasa,
the fact that Solomon asked for his discharge
so long beforehand showed a desire on his part
to play fair&mdash;and also to draw his pay on being
discharged.
</p>

<p>
"I'll speak to the captain about it, Solomon,
and I think it'll be all right.  But we'll be sorry
to lose you, for you've certainly been a great
help to us."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to be leaving you, sir," and the blue
eyes opened a trifle wider.  "Thank you werry
much, Mr. 'Ammer."
</p>

<p>
This was to be a day of surprises for Cyrus
Hammer, however.  The day was cruelly hot,
even the breeze created by the yacht's motion being
stifling, and by noon Hammer, as well as Schlak
and the others aboard, had stripped to pyjamas.
</p>

<p>
Very little had been seen of Dr. Krausz and Adolf
Jenson; most of their meals had been served in
their large cabin; and from the quantities of mail
sent out at each port of call, it had been evident
that the scientist was hard at work.
</p>

<p>
That afternoon, however, while Hammer was
splitting a bottle of beer with Harcourt in the
comparative coolness of the latter's cabin, the
steward appeared.  He was a quiet little Englishman,
who had formerly acted as Harcourt's valet
in more prosperous days, and had chosen to remain
with his master.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Harcourt," he said, hesitantly, "I'd like
to ask you about something, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Roberts.  What's on your mind, my man?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir"&mdash;and the steward twisted his cap
nervously&mdash;"it's Dr. Krausz, sir.  I'm&mdash;I'm afraid
as he's going it a bit strong, Mr. Harcourt."
</p>

<p>
"Eh?  What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, him and that&mdash;that yeller-faced swine
Jenson"&mdash;and Roberts spat out the words with a
sudden viciousness that was astounding&mdash;"I've
been a-taking them champagne, sir, all morning,
and a half-hour ago Dr. Krausz he sent for a bottle
o' brandy, sir.  I thought, maybe, as how you
might drop a word to him, sir.  It's a mortal
bad climate, you know, sir, for such goings-on."
</p>

<p>
Harcourt stared at the American, surprise plain
in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"My word!" he ejaculated.  "I'd positively no
idea that he was a tippler, 'pon my word!  Has
this been going on long, Roberts?"
</p>

<p>
"Off and on, sir, since we left Gibraltar.  But
not so heavy as this, Mr. Harcourt."
</p>

<p>
"Very good.  You did quite right in telling
me, but mention it to no one else, understand.
You may go."
</p>

<p>
Left alone, the two looked at each other for a
moment until Hammer chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"So our worthy doctor has fallen off the wagon,
eh?  Well, it's his funeral, cap'n, not ours.
Better drop him a hint?"
</p>

<p>
"Eh?  By Jove, no!  I want no bally German
telling me to keep my place!  He knows what
he's doing, Hammer, and I'm no nursemaid, so
we'll let him drink himself to death if he likes.
I'd much sooner see that fellow Jenson go
overboard in a sack, for the doctor's quite a decent
sort, don't you know."
</p>

<p>
"He might be worse," nodded Hammer.  "Well,
I'll be off and get a bit of sleep under the
after-awning by the electric fan."
</p>

<p>
Here he managed to obtain a modicum of relief
from the heat, and dropped off to sleep without
troubling himself over the alcoholism of
Dr. Sigurd Krausz.
</p>

<p>
How long he was asleep he had no idea, until
he was aroused by an excited voice, which resolved
itself into that of the doctor in question.
Half-clad, dishevelled, and with furiously-flushed
features, the archaeologist was disclaiming wildly
in German to Hans Schlak, whose watch it was.
</p>

<p>
The two were standing by the starboard rail,
and as Hammer raised himself on his hands the
second mate cast a helpless glance at him.  The
American caught the look, and did not hesitate
to break into the scientist's flow of words.
</p>

<p>
"Who's up on the bridge, Schlak?" he asked
curtly.  "You'd better get back before the
captain&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Was ist</i>?"  Krausz lurched about with a black
frown, and Schlak seized the chance to get away.
At the same instant Roberts appeared, bearing a
whisky and soda.  He hesitated at sight of Hammer.
</p>

<p>
"Throw that stuff overboard, Roberts,"
commanded the later, rising.  With a look of vast
relief the steward obeyed.  Krausz glared at them,
and the American saw the peculiar ribbon of muscle
beating furiously under the skin of his brow.
</p>

<p>
"How dare you!" burst forth the scientist.
"Pig of an American, you do not your place
know&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He was swinging his fists wildly in the air,
and by sheer accident managed to catch the tray
of Roberts with a blow that sent it clattering
to the deck.  Hammer, angry, took a step forward
and caught the German's wrists in a hard grip.
</p>

<p>
"Get command of yourself, doctor," he said
quietly.  "You're making a disgraceful scene
here."
</p>

<p>
For an instant the other glared at him with
bloodshot, maddened eyes which, despite his
light-brown hair, were of the deepest black.  Then.
Hammer caught a ripple of the man's huge muscles,
and he was flung violently back with a curse.
</p>

<p>
"Iss it not mine ship?" stormed the angry
German.  "Pig!  Dog!  I will show you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He rushed forward.  Hammer, seeing that he
had to deal with a sheer madman, wasted no more
words but struck with all his weight behind
the blow.  His fist took Krausz full in the stomach.
and with a single groan the big man shivered and
collapsed in a heap.
</p>

<p>
"Roberts," and Hammer turned to the wild-eyed
steward, "send two of the Germans here to
carry the doctor to his cabin.  Then see to it
that I am called at four bells and not disturbed
before then."
</p>

<p>
Poor Roberts fled hastily, and Hammer composed
himself to sleep again.  He would have
thought little of the incident, nor did he expect
that Krausz would remember it; but that evening
the doctor appeared at mess&mdash;a very rare thing.
His first act was to go up to the American with
hand outstretched.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Mr. Hammer," he said, sincerity in
his tone.  "I deeply regret what took place thiss
afternoon, and apologize to you for it.  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't say any more, doctor," laughed Hammer,
with an amused glance at the wondering Harcourt,
who knew nothing of the occurrence.  "It's really
not worth bothering about, I assure you, and if
anyone needs to be forgiven it is I."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," beamed the other, but the muscle
over his temple was beating hard.  "By the way,
you found no papers on the deck, yess?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't notice any," returned the surprised
American.  "Why, did you lose something?"
</p>

<p>
"A paper, yess.  Adolf believed me to have
had it when I left the cabin.  But no matter,
my friend.  We&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hold on there!" cried Hammer quickly.  "If
you lost something, we'll look into it.  Roberts!
Was anyone else on the after-deck?"
</p>

<p>
"I saw no one, Mr. Hammer," returned the
steward.  "I called the two men, as you ordered."
</p>

<p>
Hammer frowned, but Krausz waved a hand
and insisted that nothing mattered; and so the
dinner proceeded, with a brief but frank explanation
on the part of the scientist to Harcourt and John
Solomon, Schlak still being on the bridge.
</p>

<p>
Hammer was about to relieve him when Krausz
asked him to wait, as he wished to explain the
purpose of his expedition.
</p>

<p>
This proved to be of little interest to the
American, however.  The doctor had discovered,
some time before, a number of old manuscripts
dealing with the Portuguese occupation of the
Mombasa coast.
</p>

<p>
According to these, there was a place not far
from Melindi where a fort had been established,
and where, afterward, a number of vessels had
been wrecked on their way from Goa to Lisbon.
</p>

<p>
The cargoes had been saved, but before they
could be transferred to Mombasa an irruption of
natives had destroyed the fort.  It was believed
that a great portion of valuable relics, with gifts
from the Indian viceroy to the king of Portugal,
and other such things, had been buried somewhere
within the fort and had never been located.
</p>

<p>
These formed the object of the party's work;
for if found they would be of great value to
historians, more especially as there were many papers
of interest supposed to be buried with the more
intrinsically valuable articles.
</p>

<p>
The subject did not appeal particularly to
Hammer; but Harcourt displayed keen interest,
while John Solomon stared at Krausz with his
blue eyes growing wider and wider.
</p>

<p>
"And you mean as 'ow to say that there 'ere
loot is still there, doctor?" he broke forth at last.
Krausz smiled blandly.
</p>

<p>
"Such is my hope, Mr. Solomon."
</p>

<p>
"Lud!  The ways o' Prowidence are mysterious,
as the Good Book says.  To think o' loot a-laying
buried for all this time waiting for you to dig
it up!  Once upon a time I worked for a
relic-'unter, like you, sir.  A fine, upstanding man 'e
was, too.  But I says, when there's summat dead,
let it lie.  It ain't proper to dig up the past,
as the old gent said when 'e led 'is third to the
altar."
</p>

<p>
"So you used to work for an archaeologist,
yess?" and for the first time the doctor seemed
to find John Solomon worthy of attention.  "Where
wass that?"
</p>

<p>
"A main long time back, sir&mdash;up in Palestine
it was," and Solomon sighed reflectively.
</p>

<p>
Hammer, who was studying Krausz, suddenly
saw the muscle in his brow begin to throb.  He
felt himself beginning to dislike that muscle
vaguely.
</p>

<p>
"'Is name was&mdash;-dang it!  I've been and
forgot&mdash;no, I 'aven't neither!  'Is name was
'Elmuth!" he concluded triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
"Helmuth!"  The word broke from Krausz
and found echo in Hammer's mind.  The heavy-lidded
black eyes of the German were bent suddenly
on Solomon.  "The Herr Professor George Helmuth,
yess, of the University of California?"
</p>

<p>
"That's 'im, sir!"  Solomon's eyes sparkled.
"American 'e was."
</p>

<p>
"H-m!"  For some reason the doctor's face
darkened.  "Hiss daughter she iss my assistant,
Mr. Solomon.  She wass assistant curator at the
Dresden Library.  Well, my friends, I bid you
good evening."
</p>

<p>
Hammer also departed to the bridge, pondering
over the coincidence brought out by Solomon's
words; and when Harcourt joined him for a smoke
they chuckled over it together.  The captain had
already decided to let Solomon go at Mombasa,
as there would be little need of his services for a
time.
</p>

<p>
"Funny thing, that," remarked the Englishman.
"Fancy a woman doing such work out here
in Africa!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, shucks!" laughed Hammer carelessly.
"The kind of woman who goes in for that work&mdash;well,
you know.  Spectacles and Bibles and a blue
<i>pagari</i>* on her sun-helmet."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* This is the correct spelling of the word, which is bastardized
into puggaree or pugree, and other forms.  The "Standard"
will probably give pugaree, or some such spelling&mdash;<i>Author</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
So the matter passed, and for the time he forgot it.
Indeed, Hammer was busier than he had been for
many a day.  Besides lessons in navigation from
Harcourt, he was learning a smattering of Arabic
from Solomon, and already could swear fluently at
the four Arab sailors, who took a cheerful delight
in adding to his vocabulary.
</p>

<p>
Also, he was rather surprised to find that he and
Harcourt were drawing closer together with every
day; that he was keenly interested in his new
environment, and was looking forward to newer
seas and lands with unalloyed anticipation.
</p>

<p>
In fact, he was beginning to see the falsity of his
old attitude toward life, while the taste of authority
was sweet to him.  Already the past had faded out
in his mind, save for occasional twinges of bitterness,
at which times he plunged into his work and
was astonished at the ease with which the mood
passed.
</p>

<p>
So the days flew by until the <i>Daphne</i> had rounded
Cape Guardafui and the last leg of the journey
was begun, down the east coast of Africa.  They
were still three days out from Mombasa when
Hammer, who had the second dog watch, went
to Schlak's cabin on being relieved by Harcourt.
</p>

<p>
He wanted to ask the second officer about some
detail of the chart; and since it was nearly dark,
and he made no noise in his pumps, his approach
must have been unheard.
</p>

<p>
As the door was slightly ajar, Hammer merely
pushed it open with a word and stepped in.  He
heard one sharply-drawn breath, and in the gloom
found himself facing Adolf Jenson, whose face
was absolutely livid.
</p>

<p>
An instant, as he switched on the light, the
American saw the body of Hans Schlak lying on
the floor at his feet, a knife-shaft between the
shoulders.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap04"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
WHO MURDERED HANS SCHLAK?
</h3>

<p>
"My God!  Don't look at me like that,
sir&mdash;I didn't do it!"
</p>

<p>
Trembling in every limb, the secretary shrank
back against the berth, staring up at Hammer
with horrified eyes.
</p>

<p>
The American, to whom Jenson was repulsive,
made no attempt to lay a finger on the man, but
stood looking at him with sternly questioning
eyes; palsied with fear, the fellow babbled out
protestations of his innocence until suddenly
Hammer waved him silent.
</p>

<p>
"That's enough from you.  How long have you
been here?"
</p>

<p>
"I just came in, Mr. Hammer.  I can prove
it by Dr. Krausz; I've been with him until just
now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Hammer leaned over and touched Schlak.  The
second mate was dead, and had been dead for some
time, since the body was set fast in the rigor
mortis.  For a moment he looked down, frowning,
then swept the cabin with his gaze.
</p>

<p>
Evidently here had been a struggle, and a
desperate one.  A chair was broken and overturned,
clothes and papers were strewn about the
floor, and the clenched fists of the body showed
that death had not found Hans Schlak unawares.
</p>

<p>
In one hand Hammer saw a fragment of paper,
and after a moment's work got it away intact;
it was a torn corner of a letter, probably, for a
few words in German could be made out written
in pencil.
</p>

<p>
Contrary to his own will and even against his
first supposition, the American was forced to the
conclusion that the cringing secretary was innocent.
True, he had the man standing over the body,
but Schlak had been dead for an hour at least&mdash;in
all probability he had returned from the
dining-saloon to find his fate awaiting him.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, someone must have been in his room
during his absence at mess.  Who?  Not Jenson,
for Jenson had been at the table with them; and
Hammer mentally accounted for every member of
the officers' mess that evening, except John
Solomon.
</p>

<p>
An instant later he remembered that he himself
had sent the supercargo off to make up some
accounts which Harcourt desired to see, and that
Solomon had returned a few moments after Schlak
had left the table.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, it would seem that the pudgy supercargo
was cleared; and at the thought of the little
man killing the viking Hans Schlak, Hammer
smiled grimly.
</p>

<p>
"So you didn't do it, eh?" he said sternly,
thinking to make the secretary cringe for a moment.
Hammer had a thorough dislike and contempt
for the man, and made no secret of it.  "I find
you standing over this body, and you claim
innocence!  Do you think that will stand when you
get up before the German Consul at Mombasa?"
</p>

<p>
For a moment Jenson broke out anew with
his frenzied babbling, weaving his hands in and
out, his face ghastly with terror; then he caught
the American's contemptuous smile and shivered
into silence.  Hammer was satisfied, but he was
to pay dearly for that short moment of play with
Adolf Jenson's nerves.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you're cleared all right, Jenson!  Now
go down and send Captain Harcourt here, and
Dr. Krausz with him.  Tell no one else what has
happened."
</p>

<p>
With which Hammer went forward and investigated
among the crew.  But one and all could
account for themselves and proved good alibis,
even to the Arabs; so he returned in disgust to
the bridge and relieved Harcourt temporarily.
</p>

<p>
In ten minutes the captain returned with Krausz,
all three men entering the chart-house gravely
enough.
</p>

<p>
Hammer told his story, exculpating Jenson
fully, and produced the torn scrap of paper taken
from Schlak's hand.  Dr. Krausz, who had taken
the news with astonishing equanimity, examined
the paper and uttered a cry of surprise.
</p>

<p>
"It iss the paper I lost that day when I was
drank!  Mein Gott, gentlemen, but thiss iss queer!
It iss a copy of one of those Portuguese 'relations',
concerning the place to which we going are."
</p>

<p>
"So?"  Harcourt inspected the end of his cigar.
"Then whoever took it from you that day must
have been in the cabin with Schlak, and the row
probably started over that paper, by Jove!"  He
looked up with sudden excitement.  "Is anyone
else after this treasure, Dr. Krausz?"
</p>

<p>
The big German blinked in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hein</i>! It would be of no interest to others,
but to archaeologists, yess.  No one knows but
myself.  There iss not any chance of sich a thing,
I am sure."
</p>

<p>
"Well, here's the knife.  It ought to be recognized."
</p>

<p>
Harcourt laid the weapon on the table&mdash;a
plain, horn-hafted sheath-knife, with no scratch
on the haft to proclaim ownership.
</p>

<p>
As Hammer had not revealed the cause of his
visit to the forecastle, it was decided to call in
each man on board the ship, from stewards to
stokers, and see if the weapon would be recognized.
</p>

<p>
"It's a cinch that the murderer is on the
ship," declared Hammer confidently.  "If that
knife belongs to any of the men it'll probably be
recognized."
</p>

<p>
"By the way," exclaimed Harcourt, "we ought
to have Solomon up here.  I believe that chap
has some brains, and he can help us out with the
Arabs.  Can you handle their bally talk at all,
Hammer?"
</p>

<p>
"Fairly well, but not for rapid-fire work.  Yes,
better have John come up, and then start in with
the men.  I'd better get the articles and see that
we get hold of every man aboard, hadn't I?"
</p>

<p>
The captain nodded, and Hammer went below.
He went first to his own cabin, where he dug to
the bottom of a ditty-bag full of soiled linen
and fished out an old-style revolver of small size
but heavy calibre.
</p>

<p>
"Not that I want to shoot her any," he grinned
to himself, "but she feels comforting with
murderers aboard!  Guess I'd have to have a man
within a yard of me to hit him with this mule of a
gun, anyhow."
</p>

<p>
Visiting Harcourt's cabin, he procured the
ship's papers, sent Roberts to ask John Solomon
to step to the chart-house and to follow himself,
and returned.  At anyrate, he thought grimly, this
cruise bade fair to beat cattle-boats as far as
excitement was concerned.
</p>

<p>
He found the others as he had left them, Harcourt
smoking and Krausz staring glumly at the knife,
which lay on the table before them.  A moment
later the supercargo arrived, puffing after his
climb, and at Harcourt's invitation dropped into
the fourth deck-chair.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know that knife, Mr. Solomon?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, cap'n, I can't say that I do&mdash;no, sir;
I never laid eyes on it afore, not as I knows of.
I&mdash;why, dang it!  There's blood&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," cut in Harcourt grimly.  "Mr. Schlak
was murdered this evening.  Oh, hello, Roberts!
Tell the men to come up here one by one&mdash;come
in here first.  Ever see this knife before?"
</p>

<p>
Roberts approached the table and replied in
the negative, after which Harcourt waved him
away.  John Solomon said no more, but stared
from one to the other of the three, silent with
the horror of the thing.
</p>

<p>
Taking pity on him, Hammer explained the
affair, and had barely finished when the men
began to come in, wondering greatly at the time
and place of the summons.
</p>

<p>
One by one they passed through, each denying
any knowledge of the knife, and Hammer pricked
off the names.  The four Arabs had not yet appeared
when Adolf Jenson came to seek his master on
some trivial errand and stopped, pale-faced and
with a virulent glance at the American, as he noted
what was going on.
</p>

<p>
Solomon's eyes turned to him, remaining in a
fixed stare; and after a moment the secretary
evidently became uneasy, for he passed out into
the night again after returning a brief negative
to Harcourt's formal question.
</p>

<p>
There were only five men left&mdash;the four Arabs and
the German boatswain, Hugo Baumgardner.  Two
of the Arabs, the only ones who knew English,
came through, and after them the boatswain.
Then for the first time things began to look
interesting.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," replied Baumgardner slowly, scratching
his mop of black hair reflectively and speaking
excellent English, "it seems to me I've seen that
knife before; there's a funny twist to the handle
if you notice, sir."
</p>

<p>
An electric-charged silence settled down, while
Baumgardner scratched his head and stared at
the table.  From outside came a murmur of voices
from the waiting men; then very quietly John
Solomon rose and stepped to the door.
</p>

<p>
No one except Hammer paid any attention to
the movement, and the American, after noting
that Solomon was saying something to some person
out of sight, centred his thoughts on the stalwart
boatswain.
</p>

<p>
"Well, tell us where you saw it," spoke up
Krausz encouragingly, as Solomon resumed his
chair.  Baumgardner frowned heavily, then his
face cleared.
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir, it was the day after we left Malta&mdash;I
remember that Mr. Solomon was breaking out
a case of champagne and I was helping him with
it.  Yes, that's it.  I asked him for a knife&mdash;I'd
left mine in my bunk&mdash;and he passed me that one
to cut away the straw around the case.  Just
let me hold it a minute."  Harcourt passed over
the knife and the German folded his great hand
around it, nodding.  "Yes, I could swear to it,
Mr. Harcourt.  I hope there's nothing wrong, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, Baumgardner.  You have seen the
knife at no other time, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir.  I only remembered it because it had
that little hitch at the end of the handle, but it's
the same one."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  That will do."
</p>

<p>
No one said anything for a moment.  Hammer's
eyes went to Solomon, and he surprised a peculiar
look in the other's face&mdash;a peculiar look which
he could not fathom.  It was as if John Solomon's
faith in human nature had suddenly received a
shock, and if it was acting, then it was cleverly
done.
</p>

<p>
A second later the third Arab entered, replied
to Harcourt's question, which Solomon translated
with a curt negative, and passed on.  The
fourth Arab, however, glanced at the knife, and
before a word had been uttered his eyes lit up.
Harcourt caught the gleam and checked Solomon.
</p>

<p>
"Wait a moment, Mr. Solomon.  Hammer, I
think you'd better ask him, to avoid any suspicion
against Solomon's question; not that we suspect
you, Solomon, but under the circumstances it
might be better."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so, sir," rejoined the supercargo humbly.
"I'm werry sorry, o' course, sir."
</p>

<p>
Hammer put the question in faltering Arabic,
and the man nodded at once.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, <i>effendi</i>, I have seen the knife.  Has
it a small nick near the end of the blade?"
</p>

<p>
The American translated and Harcourt picked
up the weapon.
</p>

<p>
"Correct.  Ask him where he saw it."
</p>

<p>
Then Hammer received a surprise.
</p>

<p>
"I saw it two days ago, <i>effendi</i>&mdash;no, it was
four days ago, two days after <i>effendi</i> was drunk
and you hit him very hard.  I was cleaning the
brasswork.  I saw the little black man come near
me, and there was a bad place in the brass.  I
asked him if he had a knife, for I had none, and
he lent me this one.  I remember the nick in the
blade, for Allah willed that it scratch my thumb."
</p>

<p>
Startled, Hammer made the man repeat his
statement to make sure there was no mistake and
that he had understood correctly; then he translated
for the others.  He saw Krausz dart a single
flaming glance at Solomon, which the latter seemed
not to note, and then Harcourt spoke up:
</p>

<p>
"Ask him who he means by the little black man."
</p>

<p>
The Arab could not say, except that he would
know the man again; but Hammer felt no doubt
in his own mind that Jenson was indicated, and
summoned the latter.  Upon his arrival the Arab
identified him at once.
</p>

<p>
"That is the man, <i>effendi</i>.  If he says that the
knife is not his, then he is a&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The Arab's opinion of Jenson coincided more or
less with that of Hammer, but the American cut
short the Hood of expletives and ordered the man
to stand aside.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," said Harcourt gravely, "this
situation would be laughable were it not so deuced
serious.  One man states that Mr. Solomon had
the knife when he left Malta; Solomon denies
having ever seen it before; another man states
that Mr. Jenson had it since that time.  You
will have noted that the Arab recognized the blade
by its slight nick, of which he could have had no
previous knowledge.  In my opinion neither witness
is to be doubted."
</p>

<p>
Not until then did the unhappy secretary realize
what had transpired, or why he had been sent
for.  Comprehending the drift of things at Harcourt's
words, transfixed by his master's gloomy eye, poor
Jenson shrank back, trembling, an agony of fear
in his livid features.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I never had it!" he cried in a strangled
voice.  "Heir Doctor&mdash;gentlemen&mdash;I swear before
God and the Virgin&mdash;I never had the thing, never
saw it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't cry before you're hurt, Jenson," said
Harcourt coldly.  "Then you deny having had the
knife in your possession, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes!  My God, yes!"  With a sudden snarl
that brought out his rat-like teeth he whirled on
Hammer, "It's you who framed this thing up&mdash;you
always hated me; you accused me of doing
it in the first place&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Shut up!"  The heavy voice of Krausz silenced
his frenzied words.  "Captain Harcourt, you are
in command here; but if you please I would like
a word to say, yess?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, doctor."
</p>

<p>
"Then I can witness that thiss man, Adolf
Jenson, wass with me from the time I went to
my cabin after mess until five minutes before I
wass called up here.  Also, I left the dining-saloon
before Schlak did.  If poor Schlak wass
killed after then thiss must surely absolve Jenson."
</p>

<p>
"It would certainly seem to, by Jove!" exclaimed
Harcourt, frankly puzzled.  "Mr. Solomon, kindly
explain to us why you denied all knowledge of
the knife when we first asked you about it.  Do
you stick to that denial?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," and the wide blue eyes, which had
rested on Jenson with a wondering look, shifted
to Harcourt.  "You see, sir, I don't carry weapons,
not as a rule.  Everything in its place, I says,
and a supercargo 'e don't rightly 'ave no use
for knives.  When so be as I wants a knife I
gets one from the steward, or borries one anywhere.
It may be werry well be as the bos'n says&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then why did you deny it in the first place?"
shot out Harcourt sternly.
</p>

<p>
Solomon hesitated, his eyes shifting from face
to face appealingly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, I suspicioned as summat was wrong.
I don't 'old to gettin' shipmates into 'ot water,
sir, beggin' your pardon, and I says to myself,
'John Solomon, tell a lie,' just like that, sir.
'Tell a lie,' I says, 'and don't be a-gettin' of
a poor shipmate into 'ot water.  Do as you would
be done by,' I says&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Confound it," exclaimed Harcourt, "tell me
who you borrowed that knife from or I'll put you
in irons!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir," sighed the supercargo, "I must
say as I remembers it werry well, and werry sorry
I am to 'ave to say it, Mr. Jenson; but you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You lie!" screamed Jenson terribly, flinging
himself forward.  With unexpected agility
Dr. Krausz leaped up and gripped him.  "You lie!
You lie!  You lie!"  Over and over the words
were shrieked out until a torrent of German from
the scientist quieted the livid-faced secretary.
</p>

<p>
It was a scene that lingered long in the mind
of Hammer&mdash;stolid, pudgy Solomon sitting quietly
with something like sadness in his eyes, while
Jenson, an agony of dumb horror in his face,
panted in the grip of the Teuton, Harcourt watching
with a troubled frown, and the Arab standing
back in silence.
</p>

<p>
"Ordinarily that would be good evidence
enough," stated Harcourt finally.  "However, it
is only your word against Jenson's, Solomon,
with the preponderance of evidence in your favour.
</p>

<p>
"Still, Jenson has an excellent alibi.  Where were
you while you were absent from the dining-saloon?"
</p>

<p>
"In me own cabin, sir," came the prompt
answer.  "Fixing up them accounts, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Anyone see you there?"
</p>

<p>
"Not as I knows on sir."
</p>

<p>
"Then your bally alibi's smashed and we're
worse tangled up than ever!"
</p>

<p>
Silence once more settled over the chart-house.
For the life of him Hammer could not solve the
puzzle, and in desperation he suggested that
the remainder of the crew be sent for.
</p>

<p>
Since two of the forecastle mess had recognized
the weapon there was a chance that some of the
engine-room crew might have seen it and so
might corroborate either the Arab or Baumgardner.
</p>

<p>
Harcourt accordingly summoned every man on
board but with no result.  Each and all positively
denied ever having seen the knife, and finally
the Arab was dismissed with the rest, Baumgardner
being advanced to acting second mate with orders
to prepare the body of Schlak for burial the next
morning.
</p>

<p>
"I'm bally well stumped, gentlemen," announced
Harcourt wearily.  Jenson was now standing beside
his master, one of Krausz's big hands resting
on his arm.  "What's your opinion, Hammer?"
</p>

<p>
The American hesitated.  Plainly the secretary
believed him to have framed up the charge, and
it was next to impossible to believe that the fellow
had really murdered the giant mate.  Besides, the
alibi was heavily in the man's favour.
</p>

<p>
"From the evidence of the Arab and John
Solomon," he said slowly, "it would seem that
Jenson is guilty.  But the body was stiff, remember,
and there had been a struggle, to say nothing
of the alibi.  On the other hand, Solomon cannot
prove where he was at the time.  I would suggest
entering on the log that Schlak was murdered by
persons unknown, and then put the matter up
to the German Consul who would probably have
jurisdiction at Mombasa."
</p>

<p>
"No," corrected Harcourt.  "Extra territorial
rights have been withdrawn in British East Africa.
The government would have jurisdiction.  What is
your opinion, doctor?"
</p>

<p>
"I would leave it to you, captain.  I say it iss
for you to settle."
</p>

<p>
"And <i>I</i> say," exclaimed Harcourt with sudden
harshness, "that no man is to be murdered in my
ship without someone swinging for it, by the
Lord Harry!  We'll get into Kilindini, and never
a man goes ashore until this has been ferreted out.
John Solomon, and you, Adolf Jenson, mind that!"
</p>

<p>
So the matter ended for the present, after
affidavits and statements had been drawn up and
signed by all concerned.  But, as he paced the
bridge that night, Cyrus Hammer thrashed the
matter over and over in his mind.  The strands
were twisted a little bit too much to his manner
of thinking.
</p>

<p>
Solomon's absence in his own cabin was bad,
for there was nothing to prove that he had been
there, save his own word.  This, however, was
balanced by the fact that the knife seemed to
belong to Jenson, whose flat denial of this evidence
looked very bad also.  Yet his alibi was unimpeachable.
</p>

<p>
What with Baumgardner testifying against
Solomon, and the latter against Jenson, the thing
was badly tangled.  Yet the evidence was in favour
of the secretary clearly.  He would hardly have
stolen the paper from Krausz, over which the
struggle would seem to have been waged, and he
could account for his movements.
</p>

<p>
Despite the ownership of the knife, there would
seem to be a much better case against John Solomon,
except for the testimony of the Arab&mdash;and at
this the American paused.  <i>What had the supercargo
said there at the door of the chart-house</i>?
</p>

<p>
For a long moment Hammer stood staring out
at the sea, startled by this thought which had
winged its way into his brain.  Was it possible
that in that moment Solomon had given the Arab
his cue?
</p>

<p>
But why?  He had not desired to testify against
Jenson at first, beyond doubt.  Hammer's mind
flashed back again&mdash;Jenson also had left the
chart-house shortly before Baumgardner's
recognition of the blade.
</p>

<p>
Was it possible that Jenson had instructed
the boatswain what to say, that Solomon had
read his purpose and blocked the move by the
counter testimony of his Arab?
</p>

<p>
"By Godfrey," thought the American, "that's
expecting too much altogether of Solomon's wits.
Besides, Baumgardner doesn't look as if he'd
lie in order to save that little shrimp of a secretary.
Well, I guess it's up to the authorities at Mombasa,
and here's hoping they can find more sense in the
whole affair than I can."
</p>

<p>
With which he patted the side-pocket of his
coat reassuringly and devoted himself to keeping
a sharper lookout than usual.
</p>

<p>
The next morning Schlak was buried, and the
<i>Daphne</i> went once more upon her way with the
mystery still unsettled, until in due time she
rounded into Kilindini, the southern harbour of
Mombasa, and her anchors crashed down into the
waters of the port.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
THE ADVENTURE BEGINS
</h3>

<p>
Now, it is not to be expected that when a man
has been living for three years among "stiffs" and
"sunfish", with only occasional lapses into decency,
he can suddenly turn around and rank as a gentleman
and a scholar for ever after, with never a fall
from grace.
</p>

<p>
It would be very nice to chronicle such a miracle
in the life of Cyrus Hammer, and would, no doubt,
afford great pleasure to the average reader; but
it would afford great disgust to the average student
of human nature, such as John Solomon.
</p>

<p>
"Regeneration is all werry well," as that peculiar
individual said, "but it ain't to be 'ad with
a 'op, skip, and jump, I says.  'Umans is 'umans,
and nature ain't to be denied, as the parson remarked
when 'e smashed the constable in the eye.  If so
be as a man's a saint, why, 'is place ain't 'ere on
earth, says I."
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, in the due course of events, Hammer
and the rest were entertained at the Mombasa
Club, where Harcourt found numerous old friends
now "in the service".
</p>

<p>
These, with the American Consul, were so cordial
to Hammer that he and Harcourt spent one glorious
evening around a punch-bowl at the club, and
about midnight Hammer was lost in the shuffle.
At 3 A.M. he was located by a native policeman,
who patiently extricated him from the embraces
of a half-caste Portuguese and two sailors from
an oiler in port.
</p>

<p>
The extrication was a matter of time and trouble,
Hammer vowing that he was not being shanghaied
and had no intention of being so; and before the
question was settled the half-caste had a broken
head, two constables were <i>hors de combat</i>, and half
Mombasa was watching the riot in unholy glee&mdash;for
Hammer managed to hold the cathedral steps
against all comers until taken from behind.
</p>

<p>
Undoubtedly, it was a highly disgraceful scene,
and Hammer was duly contrite when his fine had
been paid and he was returned to the yacht.
Harcourt made no mention of the occurrence
thereafter, and the American savagely determined
not only to stay away from the club but to get
out of Mombasa altogether.
</p>

<p>
Wherefore it was not long until he was given
charge of the "impedimenta" belonging to
Dr. Krausz, and found himself steaming up the coast
aboard the government packet <i>Juba</i> with half a
dozen of the crew.
</p>

<p>
Krausz himself had gone on to Melindi as soon
as the investigation into the death of Schlak was
finished.  And it was quickly finished, for the
authorities, after hearing the evidence, directed
that the finding of the <i>Daphne's</i> log be confirmed,
there being no direct evidence against either
Solomon or Jenson.
</p>

<p>
Whereupon the former had at once drawn his
pay and disappeared, and the latter had gone to
Melindi with his master in the yacht's launch.
Harcourt remained in charge of the yacht for the
present.
</p>

<p>
The trip up-coast was fairly uneventful, and at
Melindi he found Jenson waiting with the launch
in which to take the men on.  He himself was
given a native guide, and was forced to get the
boxes unshipped two miles from shore, swung
into surf boats, landed, and then loaded onto a
gang of Kiswahili porters to be taken overland.
From the Kiswahili guide Hammer extracted
the information that their destination was two
days' march north from Melindi, and, perforce,
he resigned himself to the situation, roundly
cursing Jenson for leaving him in the lurch.
</p>

<p>
An English cotton-planter whom he met on the
wharfs came to the rescue, however, took charge
of his boxes and porters, and set off with him for
the first few miles&mdash;for all of which Hammer was
intensely grateful.
</p>

<p>
He was like a child in a strange house, at first;
but by the time the planter stopped off at his
own place the American had got into the swing
of things.  The planter sent him down a couple
of boys for personal attendants, and after Hammer
had attended to one insolent porter he had no
further trouble whatever.
</p>

<p>
They were headed for a small ruined fort, dating
from the Portuguese occupation, which lay sixteen
miles up the coast from Melindi.  Owing to
the difficulties of the march and the roundabout
track they were compelled to follow, it was not
until the evening of the second day that the guide
declared the fort to be near at hand.
</p>

<p>
It had formerly been built at the head of a small
bay, but, owing to changes in the conformation of
the coast, the sea had left it a half-mile away and
the bay had vanished.
</p>

<p>
As the little safari broke from a thicket of
brush and trees Hammer saw the ruins on a small
eminence from which the trees had been cleared.
</p>

<p>
At one side were two large tents, with the smaller
tents and brush huts of the native workmen scattered
down the hillside.  There seemed to be no
one in sight, however, and Hammer sent the guide
on to stir up Dr. Krausz or his assistants.
</p>

<p>
He was in an ill-humour, and made no secret of
it.  On that two days' march he had been tortured
by insects, irritated by his porters, and plagued
by the remembrance of what had occurred at
Mombasa; he decided that he thoroughly hated
East Africa, and longed to be once more out at
sea on the bridge of the <i>Daphne</i>.
</p>

<p>
"By Godfrey," he ejaculated, staring at the
silent camp ahead, "when I get out of this devilish
country I'll stay out!  The ocean is good enough
for me, and no mistake.  I wonder what's happened
to this place, anyhow?  Where are all those Dutchmen?"
</p>

<p>
The guide had run ahead to the two large tents,
where a few other natives appeared, talking to
him.  Above, the cleared hilltop showed long lines
of ruined stone-walls three or four feet in height,
crowned by one or two spreading mimosa-trees
which had evidently been too large for removal.
</p>

<p>
It was a naked-looking place, with the deep
jungle behind and around and running down
toward the shore where the sunset gleam was
striking the ocean and the eastern skies to flame,
and Hammer wondered where water came from for
camp use&mdash;a thought born of his late experiences.
</p>

<p>
This was answered by the sight of two or three
Kiswahili coming from the ruins with kettles, and
the American realized that the fort must have been
built around a spring or well.
</p>

<p>
The porters slowly wound up the hill, singing
happily enough, and half a dozen natives crowded
around the guide as he returned to meet them.  All
were capering and dancing like children, but
Hammer was in no mood to handle them gently.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he snapped, "where are the sahibs?"
</p>

<p>
"They are not here, sar," returned the guide.
"Here is one man from them," and he pointed to
a grinning fellow who stepped out boldly.
</p>

<p>
"I am Potbelly, sar; very good mission-boy,"
he announced complacently.  "Missy Professor she
say she not see you, not well in the stomach.  The
Herr Doctor, he went off this morning, sar, with
all men hereabouts, in order to engage native help
from nigger village inside of the coast.  He will
be back very immediately, sar, and Missy
Professor say you take tent&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You're blamed right, I'll take his tent,"
ejaculated Hammer angrily, "and you see that these
boys are attended to after the stuff is piled&mdash;savvy?"
</p>

<p>
Potbelly savvied and guided Hammer to one of
the two large tents.  Here he found comparative
comfort, his two personal boys making a bath
ready; but his reception was vexing in the extreme.
</p>

<p>
The Missy Professor, of course, was Professor
Sara L. Helmuth.  She probably had the other
tent, with her own attendants, and of course
Krausz would never have gone off and left her
alone unless she was perfectly safe here.  The
doctor was losing no time, evidently, since he was
already off engaging workmen and getting things
under way.
</p>

<p>
The chop-box which the planter had sent with
his boys had been used up, and as there was no
sign of eatables about the doctor's tent, Hammer
changed into some of the German's clothes and
went forth to investigate in a vile temper.
</p>

<p>
His proficiency in Arabic, of a sort, had vastly
increased since leaving Melindi, and, finding that
the natives were gathered about the boxes which
he had brought outside Professor Helmuth's tent,
he strode into the midst and demanded dinner.
</p>

<p>
Now, whether it was that the American over-estimated
the intelligence of the Kiswahili and
Arab half-castes, or whether the absence of
Potbelly in his mistress's tent left the other boys
helpless, nothing ensued save a violent jabbering,
in which every native tried to talk at once, the
whole gradually rising to a shrill outburst of angry
shouts, and Hammer's temper gave way.
</p>

<p>
Relying on the safety of his Arabic the American
made himself heard above the uproar, lashing
about with a convenient bullock-whip hide and
pouring out a raging flood of invective and expletive.
</p>

<p>
Before the face of his anger the Kiswahili melted
away in terror, and long ere his rage was exhausted
he found himself standing alone, glaring around
vainly for someone on whom to finish his vocabulary.
</p>

<p>
A moment later Potbelly appeared jauntily from
Professor Helmuth's tent, bearing a slip of paper.
With a watchful eye on the whip he handed it to
Hammer and skipped out of reach, vanishing with
a final grin.  The American opened the paper, and
was dumbfounded.  He read:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
DEAR SIR:
</p>

<p class="letter">
I would thank you to remember that there
is a lady within hearing.  If common decency
will not restrain your language, I shall be
compelled to take other measures which will
have that effect.  SARA L. HELMUTH.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Good Lord!" gasped Hammer in dismay.  "I
never had any idea&mdash;why, she must know Arabic!
Oh, darn it all, anyway&mdash;I wish I was out of this
confounded place!  Mixed up with blue-eyed fat
men and short-haired women and Dutchmen&mdash;good
<i>night</i>!"
</p>

<p>
The Kiswahili had vanished.  Potbelly had
vanished.  Even the daylight had almost vanished,
and without a word Hammer flung down the whip,
tore the note into pieces and threw it to the breeze,
then turned to the tent of the "lady professor", as
he mentally termed her.
</p>

<p>
"Very sorry, Professor Helmuth."  He raised his
voice, but without especial civility in his tone.  "I
apologize, of course.  I didn't know you understood
Arabic.  I'll trouble you no more."
</p>

<p>
As no answer came he returned to the other tent,
and in desperation seated himself on a camp-stool.
With his pipe alight, he faced the fast-gathering
shadows outside, and a few moments later was
startled by a wild outburst of yells.
</p>

<p>
Knowing nothing of the country, when the yells
grew closer and more threatening the American
leaped to the conclusion that the natives were on
the war-path, and he leaped up.
</p>

<p>
Almost at his side stood a heavy, double-barrelled
shotgun, and, making sure that this was loaded, he
stepped to the front of the tent to investigate.  No
one seemed to be in sight, for darkness was almost
on the camp; but, seeing a light in the other tent,
he walked toward it with the idea of defending the
lady professor.
</p>

<p>
The place was an inferno, what with the shrill
yells and occasional shots; and from the noise,
Hammer concluded that the camp must be
surrounded by hundreds of men.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a dark figure loomed up in the dusk a
few feet away, and instantly he brought up his
weapon.
</p>

<p>
"Hold on!" he shouted angrily.  "Who the
devil are you?"
</p>

<p>
For answer he felt the barrel of the gun gripped
and flung up, and found himself looking into the
wrong end of a revolver.  Then&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mein Gott</i>! It iss Mr. Hammer!"
</p>

<p>
"Krausz&mdash;good Lord, I nearly plugged you.
man!  What's going on here, an attack?"
</p>

<p>
The other stared at him a moment, their faces
close.  Hammer was quick to observe a startled
suspicion in the Teuton's heavy features, and the
revolver did not go down.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing with that gun?" demanded
Krausz threateningly.
</p>

<p>
"Holding it," was the American's laconic
response.  Then, at a fresh outburst of yells: "You
aren't going to stand here and be murdered, I
hope?"
</p>

<p>
"Murdered?  <i>Hein</i>?" For an instant the other
was puzzled, then his teeth flashed in a sudden
laugh as he understood.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you thought it wass an attack, yess?  And
so you got out the gun&mdash;ho-ho!  Come to my
tent&mdash;&mdash;  Pardon, me, but I must laugh, for it iss but
my home-coming, Mr. Hammer.  Have you dined?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't anything.  I'm stiff and sore and
grouchy, and all I want is to get out of this blasted
country as quick as I can."
</p>

<p>
The doctor laughed again, and they returned to
the tent together.  Before Krausz had finished his
bath the camp had undergone a transformation in
Hammer's eyes.  Fires had been built, around
which masses of natives were grouped; there was
a smell of roasting meat in the air, and brush huts
were being quickly put up by the dozen.
</p>

<p>
Jenson received a sound berating for not having
attended to Hammer's wants in better fashion at
Melindi, and by the time they sat down to mess
with the secretary and Baumgardner, the American
was feeling more like himself.
</p>

<p>
Still, he reflected, if the country was as peaceable
and quiet as the scientist declared it to be,
that revolver had flashed out with marvellous
promptitude.
</p>

<p>
Professor Helmuth had been on the ground nearly
two weeks, and had made things ready generally
against the doctor's arrival, with the assistance of
a few mission-boys.
</p>

<p>
The Kiswahili, it seemed, had refused to leave
their fields to work for a woman, even at the
urging of the district commissioner; but Krausz
had easily procured two hundred of them, who
would dig trenches and bring in food supplies for
the whole camp.
</p>

<p>
Now that he was here, he confidently predicted
that things would go forward with a rush; but
whether it was the champagne, served abundantly
with dinner, or whether the remembrance of that
flourished revolver still stuck in Hammer's crop,
he did not exactly like the way in which the
archaeologist referred to his assistant.
</p>

<p>
He learned that the lady professor kept strictly
to herself after working hours, even to taking her
meals apart; and this did not raise her in the
American's estimation.
</p>

<p>
In her position, he considered, she should frankly
accept such things and not be so stuck on
conventions.  None the less, when he expressed
himself in such wise f Dr. Krausz took it as a huge
joke and poked Jenson familiarly in the ribs,
upon which another bottle of champagne was
opened.
</p>

<p>
Hammer, who had absorbed his full share in
his bitterness of spirit, suddenly felt out of humour
with the Teutonic attitude of mind toward women
in general.  Spectacles or no spectacles, if the lady
hailed from California then she ought to have
more sense, and probably these Germans had
handled her coarsely.  So he leaned over the table
and said as much with the innate earnestness of
his convictions.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Nein</i>," returned the doctor good-humouredly;
"I am not German, but Saxon, yess!  So you think
she wass not asked rightly, Mr. Hammer?  Perhaps
if you asked her then she might come, no?"
</p>

<p>
"By Godfrey, if she's American I'd take a
gamble on it!" blurted out Hammer, and wagged
a long forefinger under the nose of Krausz.  "I'll
bet you that I could get her over quick enough!
I'll bet a million dollars I could do it!"
</p>

<p>
"So?"  The archaeologist turned and leered
heavily at the others.  "You hear, gentlemen?
Then it iss a bet&mdash;a bet of one million dollars,
yess!  The <i>fräulein</i>, she does not like to eat with
you, Jenson, <i>hein</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Jenson babbled something, Baumgardner boomed
out a stolid assent, and Hammer had a sudden
conviction that if he took another glass of
champagne he was going to be very very drunk indeed,
whereupon he removed his shoes and climbed
inside the doctor's mosquito shelter.
</p>

<p>
In the morning he realized that that extra glass
would have been entirely superfluous, to judge
from his head.  It was after nine, but he had a tub
and a cup of coffee and felt considerably improved,
and, finding from the boys that everyone was at
work on the hill, he donned his new sun-helmet
and started for the ruins above.
</p>

<p>
Each of the German sailors had charge of a gang
of fifteen or twenty natives, and trenches were
being laid out between the lines of the old walls,
under the supervision of Krausz, who sat beneath
a grass-thatched shelter at a table with Jenson.
The doctor greeted him with a cordial grin, though
for some reason&mdash;probably the heat&mdash;the ribbon
of muscle in his temple was throbbing noticeably.
</p>

<p>
"And the <i>fräulein</i>&mdash;she will dine with us this
evening?"
</p>

<p>
"Huh?"
</p>

<p>
Hammer stared, astonished, until the wager
was brought slowly to his recollection.  Then he
looked around in some dismay, but the lady professor
had not left her tent and the doctor failed
to assign any reason thereto.
</p>

<p>
"Then I guess she won't leave for me," and
Hammer ruefully related the incident of the note
he had received the evening before, at which the
doctor laughed uproariously, and even Jenson
cracked a sly smile.  Krausz explained that
Professor Helmuth was an expert in Semitic languages,
and also that the bet was off.
</p>

<p>
"Your beastly champagne did it," said Hammer
irritably.
</p>

<p>
"But listen!"  Earnestness swept into the
doctor's heavy black eyes and his hand went to
the American's arm.  "If you will do it, yess, I
will pay one hundred dollars&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You'll&mdash;<i>what</i>?"  Hammer stared at him a
moment, then flung off the hand as he turned away.
"Been hitting up the booze again this morning,
have you?  I'll thank you to get that launch
ready for me to get back to Melindi in.  As for
your she-professor, I'll have her over to dine this
evening just to show you what a blooming fool
you are, doctor.  Then I'll start back in the launch
after dark.  I've had enough of this place."
</p>

<p>
How his remarks were received he did not see,
for he strode downhill without once looking back.
But the scientist's offer to pay him for getting
Professor Helmuth to dine with them was both
disgusting and illuminating.
</p>

<p>
It filled him with distaste for everything German&mdash;or
Saxon&mdash;with particular emphasis upon Krausz'
ribbon of muscle; and it also made him wonder
why the she-professor was refusing to honour the
general mess with her company.  Did she carry
primness to such a limit?
</p>

<p>
"I'll fix her," he said, and upon reaching his
tent sent a boy for Potbelly.  When that individual
appeared, Hammer gave him his name, stated
that he was an American, and said to tell Professor
Helmuth that he intended to call on her in ten
minutes.
</p>

<p>
Potbelly's grin vanished and he looked ugly
instantly, whereat Hammer took him by the
shoulder and assisted him from the tent with a
kick.
</p>

<p>
He watched Potbelly disappear inside the other
large tent, then sat down and smoked his pipe.
</p>

<p>
When the ten minutes were up he promptly
knocked the ashes out of his pipe, began to whistle
and started for the other tent.
</p>

<p>
Potbelly looked out, vanished again, and the
next minute the tent-flap was pushed aside and
Hammer obtained his first view of Professor Sara
L. Helmuth&mdash;and he was undoubtedly the most
astonished man in the whole of British East Africa
at that instant.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
THE LADY PROFESSOR
</h3>

<p>
The American's dreams of spectacles and blue
<i>pagaris</i> was swept away, for standing facing him
with expectant eyes was&mdash;a girl or a woman,
Hammer could not tell which.
</p>

<p>
There was some mistake, of course; self-possessed,
cool, deliberate in word and look as she
was, this slender, brown-haired, brown-eyed girl
could not be the austere mistress of Semitic
tongues&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon," he found himself stammering
weakly.  "I didn't mean that message for
you; I wanted to see Miss Helmuth, the scientific
person who doesn't like my Arabic cuss-words."
</p>

<p>
A trace of red crept through her cheeks, but her
eyes held his with no response to the whimsical
laugh of him.
</p>

<p>
"I am Miss Helmuth," she said coldly enough,
not moving that he might enter the tent, and
appraising him keenly as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
Hammer stared at her in open disbelief, but not
for long.  Something in the curve of the dark
eyebrows and the set of the girlish mouth, something
in the poise of the small head, gave a hint
of resolution and firmness&mdash;and Hammer took the
hint.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," and he bowed with his fine smile, "I
trust you will pardon my surprise.  I was looking
for a spectacled, gaunt lady of uncertain age, and
never expected to find&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I am not interested in your expectations,
Mr. Hammer," her reply came coldly.  "What is your
business with me?"
</p>

<p>
Again Hammer was taken all aback and could
not quite readjust himself.
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"  It struck him that she would
think that he was attempting to flirt with her, and
the thought sent him floundering deeper.  "You
see, Miss&mdash;Professor, I mean&mdash;Professor Helmuth,
I'm first officer of the <i>Daphne</i>, and&mdash;&mdash;  Oh, blame
it all!  Honest, Miss Helmuth, get that look off
your face or I'll run!"
</p>

<p>
A flicker of amusement came into her brown
eyes, then it passed, and her look hardened
strangely.  Hammer could almost have imagined
that she had been crying not so very long ago.
</p>

<p>
"Really, Mr. Hammer, I think that would be
the best thing you could do.  I have no desire to
have any dealings with you whatever.  Kindly
state your business and go."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's flat enough, anyhow."  Hammer's
eyes flashed for a second.  "But I must say that
such downright discourtesy doesn't go with your
looks, professor, though anything might be
expected of this outfit.
</p>

<p>
"Still, as an American, you ought logically to
be a little more human and a little less priggish.
If we were on Fifth Avenue I wouldn't blame you,
but here in Africa I should think you'd have more
sense."
</p>

<p>
She gazed at him, her eyes widening, as if this
direct attack startled and surprised her.  Hammer
was instantly contrite.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I apologize again, professor.  You
certainly riled me up for a minute, and I'm sorry I
expressed myself so bluntly.  I guess Krausz wasn't
to blame so much as I thought he was, if you
handled him like that.  You see, I came over to
ask you if you wouldn't show up at&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"So you dare to carry out that bet made in a
drinking bout with that man Krausz and his
associates?"  Poor Hammer's jaw dropped as she
straightened up, anger in every feature, and fairly
flung the words at him.
</p>

<p>
"Haven't I been put to enough shame without
having my name bandied about over the wine and
cigars?  For a moment you nearly deluded me
into thinking you a man of another kind, Mr. Hammer."
</p>

<p>
"Eh?  Say, professor, I don't think I'm wise
to all this business by a long shot!  Look
here&mdash;&mdash;  No, don't fire up yet for a minute&mdash;&mdash;  Tell me
how you knew about that affair?  It's true, of
course&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
There was scorn in her eyes as the American
stopped, embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
"If you want to know, I heard of it through one
of my boys, who got it from your own boys.  Now,
Mr. Hammer, you know the penalty attached to
entering this tent.  If you dare to attempt it,
either you or your associates, I shall carry out my
threat to the letter.  You may carry back that
report.  Good day."
</p>

<p>
With that she turned inside, but before she
could lower the flap Hammer sprang forward.  His
mind was in a swirl, and he only realized the one
great fact that this woman had a very wrong idea
of him and of his intentions.  Catching the flap
from the outside, he paused as she whirled on him
indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"Just a minute, Miss Helmuth!  Look here!
I'm not an associate of Dr. Krausz, in the first
place, and in the next I don't intend to carry back
any report.  But I do want to square myself with
you, honest, and I think you might give me a
chance."
</p>

<p>
He found himself, for the second time within
twenty-four hours, looking squarely into the
muzzle of a revolver which she had plucked from
the table behind her.
</p>

<p>
"You step inside this tent, Mr. Hammer, and
I fire."
</p>

<p>
"But, confound it!" he cried, astounded, "I
haven't done&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Let go that flap and get out of here!"
</p>

<p>
Helplessly, Hammer stared into her brown eyes
and read determination there.  He made one more
attempt, however.
</p>

<p>
"Please listen to reason, professor!  I'm not
trying to put anything over on you; all I want is
to get out of this accursed place and to make you
look at the thing straight before I go.  I didn't
know I'd got in so bad&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Let go that flap or I'll have my boys force
you out of here bodily!"
</p>

<p>
The brown eyes were blazing with fury, but
Hammer thought that never had he seen a woman
look so beautiful, so capable of taking care of
herself, so thoroughly efficient.
</p>

<p>
Realizing that she was in no mood to be argued
with, however, he obeyed her command; and as he
turned on his heel a single word broke from him
with uncontrolled emphasis:
</p>

<p>
"Damn!"
</p>

<p>
The grinning face of Potbelly peered at him
from a corner of the tent, and he strode back to
the other canvas with his ears burning.  It would
have been a bad moment for any who had interfered
with him just then, and perhaps the cunning
Kiswahili recognized the fact, for they kept well
out of his way.
</p>

<p>
The humiliation of the interview was maddening
to him; and when he called the boys who had
been loaned him by the planter and found that
they had slipped home early that morning, he was
in savage humour.
</p>

<p>
For a moment he determined to return to the
tent of Professor Helmuth and dare her to carry
out her threat, but second thought decided him
against it.
</p>

<p>
She had been in earnest beyond any doubt&mdash;but
why?  From the very face of her, she had too
much good hard sense to be the prig Krausz had
painted her; and why should she be willing to
carry out so desperate a threat?
</p>

<p>
At this he recalled her words: "You know the
penalty attached to entering this tent."  Why had
this girl set such a penalty?  That she had done
so, publicly, was evident from her words, nor did
she bear Dr. Sigurd Krausz any great love; yet she
was his assistant; she had come out from Dresden
in charge of the preliminary work; she must have
known him well before she started; and, above
all, Krausz was an eminent man in his line of
work.
</p>

<p>
Yet Hammer knew only too well how a man,
once away from his natural environment, may do
things he never would have dreamed of doing
otherwise.  Could it be that Dr. Krausz, or others
of the party, had insulted the girl?
</p>

<p>
"By Godfrey!  That name Sara isn't so bad after
all, come to think of it," and Hammer rose,
frowning.  "I guess I'll go up and see that chap.
If he's been cutting any didoes around here I'll
show him a few things.  I wish Harcourt was here;
I'm blessed if I know what to make of it all!"
</p>

<p>
He passed the she-professor's tent and strode up
the hill; for if there was to be trouble with the
doctor, he wanted to have it over with at once.
</p>

<p>
And as he went he patted the side-pocket of his
coat, where his old-style revolver still reposed; he
remembered the way Krausz had whipped out his
weapon the evening before, and the thought was
hardly reassuring.
</p>

<p>
He found the doctor as he had left him, and under
the direction of the Germans the natives were
beginning to make the dirt fly.  Krausz looked up,
his heavy eyes narrowing slightly at sight of the
American's face; then he smiled cordially.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. Hammer?  And how did you find
the <i>fräulein</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"A darned sight worse than I expected,"
returned Hammer frankly.  "See here, doctor: I'd
like to know why she won't let a man enter her
tent under pain of firing at him, and why she's
holding a grudge against you?"
</p>

<p>
The ribbon of muscle began to beat under the
skin of the other's brow, though Krausz's
expression never changed.  Jenson apparently, paid no
attention.
</p>

<p>
"Pouf!"  The big Saxon spread his hands with
a Continental shrug.  "My dear fellow, it iss her
fancy.  What can you expect?  She hass never
been here in Africa before, and she iss nervous.
Ass to dissliking me, why should she?  Wass I not
her father's friend before he died?"
</p>

<p>
"How the devil do I know?  It's a cinch she
hasn't any love for you, doctor; and I'd like to
know why that girl has to barricade herself in her
tent, that's all.  What's more, she isn't the sort
to be nervous."
</p>

<p>
Hammer looked down at the other, hands on
his hips, his brown face determined.  He realized
that he was beginning to dislike the sight hissing
accent of his employer, no less than that curious
muscle in the forehead, and the aggressive note in
his voice was thinly veiled.
</p>

<p>
Krausz seemed surprised at the change in his
first officer, and once more his eyes narrowed; but
this time they were menacing&mdash;so menacing that
Hammer felt uneasy.
</p>

<p>
"Are you her guardian, Mr. Hammer?"
</p>

<p>
"No; but I'm an American, and I used to be a
gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"Then you will please not interfere in a family
affair, my friend.  I am her guardian, the executor
of her father's estate&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Now, see here, doctor.  I'm not hunting trouble,
understand; but I'm fairly competent to handle
any that comes my way.  To know Semitic languages
and be curator in a big Dresden library takes time
and work; besides, I can tell from that girl's face
that she's of age.  You're not her guardian any
more than I am, if you want it straight."
</p>

<p>
"My dear sir, you missunderstand!  Yess, she
iss twenty-three years of age, but I wass her
guardian, ass she will tell you.  I wass her father's
best friend, and in my arms he died, yess.  It wass
I who got her that library position.  Ah, come!"  Krausz
rose quickly and patted Hammer on the
shoulder, smilingly.  "You and I, we are too big
men, yess, to be losing good humour over a little
girl!  <i>Lieber Gott</i>!  Iss she not to me like a daughter,
no?  Come down to luncheon, my friend, and over
a bottle will we forget all thiss&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No more bottles, I guess," said Hammer
decidedly.  None the less, the scientist's words
had their effect.  "However, I don't want to butt
in, doctor, and I'm sorry I made a mistake.  I go
back to-night, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Yess; Baumgardner shall take you in the launch."
</p>

<p>
So the matter was closed.  The American still
felt a trifle uneasy; but Dr. Krausz' words had
placed the affair in a new light before him, and he
forced himself to the belief that he had interfered
in some petty quarrel where he had no concern.
Krausz had succeeded in spiking his guns.
</p>

<p>
With Jenson and Baumgardner, they sat down
to a very enjoyable lunch in the doctor's tent; for
Krausz seemed to have brought no end of chop-boxes
from Mombasa, and the natives had fetched
in plenty of fruit, vegetables, and fresh meat.
</p>

<p>
Even Jenson seemed to attain some semblance of
life, almost growing enthusiastic over the work
that had been begun; and the American found
Krausz cordial and entertaining as he had rarely
been before.  He had an unfailing supply of his
long black panatelas; and while all four of them
were sitting smoking and chatting over their
coffee, there came a sudden interruption.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hodi</i>!"
</p>

<p>
All turned.  There, standing unconcernedly in
the doorway, was a native streaked with sweat,
his eyes roving from face to face, a heavy fold of
skin hanging in the slit lobe of one ear.  Several
of the camp-boys stood behind him uncertainly.
Once more he repeated the Kiswahili greeting.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hodi</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Karibu</i>," grunted Krausz; and then in English:
"Who are you?  What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bwana</i> Hammer?" came the laconic query.
</p>

<p>
"That's me!" exclaimed the American.  "What
do you want?"
</p>

<p>
The Kiswahili looked him over for a second,
then nodded as if to himself and drew the skin
from his ear-lobe.  From it he took a small packet
and handed it to the American, after which, not
deigning to say another word, he turned and
stalked away.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's a funny proposition!" exclaimed
Hammer, staring at the heavy little object in his
hand.  The others said nothing, but Krausz smoked
furiously as he watched.  Out of sheer decency
Hammer felt that he mast open the thing before
them, and proceeded to do so, wondering greatly
what it was and why the bearer had not been more
loquacious.
</p>

<p>
Unwrapping a heavy fold of tissue-paper, he
caught a little silver ring that leaped out into his
hand.  It was a cheap thing enough, and he remembered
having seen just such things sold to tourists
at Port Said, with "Arabic initials engraved while
you wait."
</p>

<p>
Sure enough, looking closer at it, he perceived a
thin tracery on the signet side; but his slight
knowledge of Arabic did not extend to reading the
language, and he passed it over to the doctor with
a surprised laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Can you read Arabic, doctor?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Nein</i>.  Wass there no writing?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a scrap," said Hammer.  "Let's get that
boy back here."
</p>

<p>
The messenger was sent for, but he proved to
have left camp without waiting to so much as be
fed&mdash;a thing unusual, to provoke comment from
the other natives.
</p>

<p>
"Well"&mdash;and Dr. Krausz shrugged his shoulders
as he rose&mdash;"there iss some misstake, or the letter
hass been lost.  It iss but a trifle.  We must get
back to work, my friends, for the afternoon iss
getting on."
</p>

<p>
The others rose with a sigh, and they went off
together, Hammer stretching out luxuriously on a
cot and wondering afresh where this mysterious
little ring could have come from, and what the
engraving meant.  It was irritating, from its very
littleness, while the strange conduct of the
messenger refused to be explained away.
</p>

<p>
If the thing had come from Harcourt it would
have had some word with it.  In any case, what
reason would Harcourt have for sending such a
thing?
</p>

<p>
It had probably come from Melindi, however,
and Hammer had not the faintest idea of who
could have sent it from there.
</p>

<p>
The odd part of it was that the worth of the ring
itself must be far below the cost of the messenger's
services, nor was there any apparent reason for
the ending of it.
</p>

<p>
"By Godfrey," thought Hammer suddenly, "I'll
send it over to Miss Helmuth!"
</p>

<p>
Clapping his hands, he sent a boy for Potbelly.
Since the Lady Professor was an adept at Arabic
to the extent of understanding certain expressions
which would hardly bear adequate translation,
Hammer saw no reason why she could not decipher
the engraving for him.
</p>

<p>
After he had sent the boy he hesitated,
remembering the humiliation he had already passed
through; but a moment later Potbelly appeared
at the entrance of the tent.
</p>

<p>
"Come here," said Hammer curtly, holding out
the ring.  "You see this?  Take it to Professor
Helmuth.  Ask her to tell what this means&mdash;&mdash;  Why,
what the devil's the matter with you?"
</p>

<p>
Potbelly's grin had faded suddenly; rather, it
had been frozen into a ghastly semblance of mirth,
and he looked from the ring to Hammer with
absolute terror.
</p>

<p>
"You savvy him, <i>Bwana</i>?" he whimpered.  "You
savvy <i>Bwana</i> John?"
</p>

<p>
"What Master John?" repeated the American
suspiciously, then grinned.  "John Jones or John
Solomon?"
</p>

<p>
To his intense amazement, Potbelly merely
whimpered again, then turned, speaking over his
shoulder as he went through the door.
</p>

<p>
"You come, <i>Bwana</i>.  I think mebbeso Missy
Professor she see you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll be darned!" murmured Hammer, and
followed like a man in a dream.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
HAMMER STARTS SOMETHING
</h3>

<p>
The American was at a loss to make out what
had happened to Potbelly.  The mission-boy had
arrived grinningly, almost insolently, and after a
look at the ring he had seemed to be transfixed by
terror.  What was there about that ring to create
such an impression?  Certainly it looked harmless
enough, and Herr Krausz would have observed
anything unduly curious about it.
</p>

<p>
From inside the tent of Professor Helmuth he
could hear, as he waited, Potbelly's voice rising
shrilly, though the words were lost.  Then came a
softer, deeper voice, which he recognized as that
of the lady in question.  He grinned to himself as
he remembered her cool determination of that
morning.
</p>

<p>
"I guess Potbelly's having his troubles about
now," he thought.  "By Godfrey, I'll have to get
to the bottom of this mystery some way!  And the
only way to do it, I guess, is to have a frank
explanation with Professor Sara L. Helmuth&mdash;bless
her brown eyes!  I wonder why I never liked that
name Sara before now!"
</p>

<p>
Hammer was still cogitating this all-important
point when he saw Potbelly's black visage appear
from the tent-flap, and the boy beckoned hastily.
The American, holding the ring in his hand, stepped
to the tent door.
</p>

<p>
Sara L. Helmuth, professor and mistress of
Semitic languages, was sitting at the table inside,
a revolver ready to her hand.
</p>

<p>
Simply and coolly dressed in white, with her
rippling brown hair coiled loosely on her head, she
offered an extremely attractive picture to Cyrus
Hammer, is spite of the circles of weariness and
trouble about her eyes.
</p>

<p>
He had always felt a weakness for women who
were self-reliant without becoming, as he had
phrased it, "short-haired", and that she was such
a woman had been evident from the first.  Moreover,
the doctor had said that she was just twenty-three.
</p>

<p>
She did not rise, but stood looking at him for a
moment, and Hammer felt that to her the situation
was, for some reason, very grave.  Instinctively he
sympathized with her, and under the thought his
face lost its harder outlines, though it retained to
the full all its rugged, healthy strength.  Then she
waved her hand toward a camp-stool just inside
the door.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, Mr. Hammer.  Make sure the boys
are watching, Potbelly."
</p>

<p>
The mission-boy disappeared.  Hammer felt
unaccountably at a loss, as though all his assurance
were ebbing away beneath her steady gaze, and
waited for her to speak.
</p>

<p>
"Potbelly tells me, Mr. Hammer, that you
have come from Mr. Solomon.  If that was true,
why did you not speak of it this morning?"
</p>

<p>
"Eh?" he stammered, utterly bewildered.
"Mr. Solomon?  You mean John Solomon?"
</p>

<p>
"Who else would I mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;Miss Helmuth, I&mdash;you can search me!
I haven't come from John Solomon, not that I
know of.  What's got into that fellow of yours,
anyway?  Now please don't look like that"&mdash;for
she had suddenly stiffened in her chair, her
eyes cold&mdash;"but I can't make head or tale of this
thing, professor.  That's straight!
</p>

<p>
"I didn't tell Potbelly that I wanted to see you,
and I didn't send him to you with that message.
I wanted him to ask you if you could read the seal
engraving on this ring, for it looks like Arabic.
He jumped off on his own hook and told me to
come along."
</p>

<p>
There was unbelief in the brown eyes that gazed
searchingly into his, but the American's whole
attitude betrayed the sincerity behind his words.
Slowly the girl relaxed in her chair, and held out
her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Let me see the ring."
</p>

<p>
He gave it to her in silence.  She bent over it
a moment, then rose with lithe grace and took an
enlarging glass from an open suitcase near by.
</p>

<p>
She stood by the light of the open flap, scrutinising
it closely, while Hammer's eyes wandered
over her slender figure and jerked back quickly
to her face, almost guiltily: for Cyrus Hammer
was like most highly-strung, clean, hard-living
men in that he idealized women in general, and
his own women friends in particular.
</p>

<p>
That, indeed, had contributed largely to his
utter demoralization after the disillusion that had
come upon him three years before.
</p>

<p>
"Where did you get this ring, Mr. Hammer?"
</p>

<p>
He started, for his thoughts had been far away.
She returned to her seat, having seemingly lost
her fear for a moment, and he told her how the
ring had been brought to him an hour before, and
how the messenger had straightway departed
without a word of explanation.  While he spoke
her eyes searched his face keenly, and at the end
she nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose your story is true, Mr. Hammer;
though it sounds rather odd, I must admit that
there is truth in your face.  That is exactly what
I cannot understand."
</p>

<p>
"You can't?  Why not, please?  You must have
a pretty bad opinion of people!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, perhaps I have some reason for it,
Mr. Hammer.  But&mdash;well, no matter.  Where is
Mr. Solomon?  Have you seen him?"
</p>

<p>
"Not since he left the yacht," and Hammer
told what he knew of John Solomon.  It occurred
to him that this was a chance to heal the breach,
and accordingly he dilated upon Dr. Sigurd Krausz
as a side-issue, putting in as good a word for the
scientist as he could.  He did not see that suspicion
was darkening in the girl's brown eyes as he
proceeded, nor did he note that her hand had closed
once more upon the revolver, until she held out
the ring and interrupted bluntly.
</p>

<p>
"That is enough, thank you.  This ring, as you
probably know, bears the Arabic name of Suleiman,
or Solomon.  There is no use saying any more in
favour of Dr. Krausz, Mr. Hammer.  Your story
is rather improbable, to say the least."
</p>

<p>
"Why, what do you mean?"  He was once more
startled by her sudden change of front, comprehending
that she had resumed her hostile attitude.
"I wish you would tell me if I can be of any help
to you, Miss Helmuth!  I put it up to the doctor
flat, and he told me to keep out of a family row,
but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Now, listen, please," she broke in again, her
voice cold&mdash;almost desperate, he thought vaguely.
</p>

<p>
"Your story is not convincing, Mr. Hammer,
and I am frankly afraid that you think me a good
deal of a simpleton.  That ring may have come
from John Solomon and it may not, but under
the circumstances I prefer to take no chances.
</p>

<p>
"I never met Mr. Solomon, and I never met you;
I am practically helpless here, except for my four
mission boys, and while you and the doctor may
pull the wool over their eyes, I intend to take care
of myself.
</p>

<p>
"When you can produce Mr. Solomon to vouch
for you, then things will be different.  Until then,
I must decline to have any further communication
with you."
</p>

<p>
Poor Hammer stared at her, wondering which
of them was crazy.  A moment before she had
seemed perfectly amenable to reason, but his
references to Krausz seemed to have flicked her on
the raw and turned her against him again.
</p>

<p>
"But, Miss Helmuth, can't you see that I am
trying to help you?  Good Heavens, girl, I'm not
any great friend of the doctor!  Things here look
pretty badly for me, and I'm only anxious to help
you if I can.  Why are you helpless here?  I can't
very well go after Krausz with a shotgun without
knowing why!"
</p>

<p>
"I think you know why, Mr. Hammer, and I
don't believe there is any use in discussing the
matter further.  There is only one man I can trust,
and if you have been telling the truth I will be
glad to apologize.
</p>

<p>
"But you are either a great fool or you are very
ignorant of conditions, and if you came from
Mr. Solomon I do not think you would be in either
category.
</p>

<p>
"I can only conclude that you are, as you yourself
admitted, in the pay of Dr. Krausz.  If Mr. Solomon
comes, as I have prayed he will come
then he may be able to vouch for you.  If not&mdash;well,
I shall not give up without a fight, that's all."
</p>

<p>
She rose in dismissal, but Hammer refused to
budge.
</p>

<p>
"Give up what, Miss Helmuth?  I'm sorry you
don't believe me, but I don't know what the row
is about."
</p>

<p>
The brown eyes gazed at him steadily, almost
contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
"How did Dr. Krausz know that I had appealed
to Mr. Solomon for aid?"
</p>

<p>
"He didn't, that I know of," retorted the
American, losing patience.  "What on earth is
all this talk about that little fat man, anyway?
You say you've never met him, then you say that
he's the only man you can trust and to bring him
along to vouch for me.  If I do, who's going to
vouch for him, I'd like to know?"
</p>

<p>
Her eyes dilated slowly, and Hammer was under
the impression that his words had had some effect.
He was soon undeceived, however.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, is he a little fat man with big blue eyes?"
and there was amazement in her voice.
</p>

<p>
"He is," returned Hammer ungraciously.  "Also,
he's in the employ of Dr. Krausz as supercargo&mdash;same
as me, if you please.  Also, I think he's the
biggest liar unhung.  I can't quite see the
connection between you and him, professor."
</p>

<p>
"Then&mdash;he was the man who came on the <i>Mombasa</i>&mdash;&mdash;"
she began as if speaking to herself,
stopping abruptly and gazing at Hammer as if he
had surprised her into revealing some secret.  He
paid slight attention to her words, for he was
trying to find the clue which so persistently eluded
his efforts.
</p>

<p>
Certainly his own statements were a good deal
more lucid than hers, and were not so conflicting
by half.  Yet she seemed to think that he and Krausz
were leagued against her in some way and that
the ring was some kind of a trick.
</p>

<p>
She claimed never to have met Solomon, yet
described him and seemed to trust him implicitly!
Small wonder that the American groaned to
himself in despair.
</p>

<p>
Sara Helmuth was still standing, however, and
now she looked down at him with angry eyes; but
Hammer thought that seldom had he seen so
magnificent a girl even though her mind might
be a trifle unbalanced.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to be insensible to my invitation to
depart, Mr. Hammer," and there was cold rage in
her voice; "and since you have been clever enough
to worm most of the secret out of me, I'll tell you
the rest in order to get rid of you.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Solomon came aboard the <i>Mombasa</i> at
London, stating that he was a messenger from
John Solomon and proving it quite efficiently.
Naturally I did not recognize him, but I turned
over to him the papers, and received them in
duplicate when I reached Mombasa from the hands of
Potbelly.
</p>

<p>
"They must have been cabled out, but in any
case Potbelly has shown himself worthy of trust,
except in this one instance of your fraudulent ring.
That is all I know, and you can take it back to
your master and share the knowledge with him.
Now will you go?"
</p>

<p>
Hammer began to see light for the first time
since the conversation began.  John Solomon's
hurried trip aboard the <i>Mombasa</i> was explained,
it seemed; also the conflicting statements of Miss
Helmuth began to straighten themselves out.
</p>

<p>
And yet the thing sounded so incredible!  John
Solomon, a fat little cockney supercargo, in league
with this girl he had only seen once&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I'll go," he said helplessly, "but I'm going to
have this thing out with Krausz and see what
screw is loose, Miss Helmuth.  I still can't
understand your connection with that little rat
Solomon&mdash;but I'll go."
</p>

<p>
So he went, without a word more from her,
back to the other tent, where he filled his pipe and
tried to get the affair into more lucid shape within
his own mind.  The effort was vain, however.
</p>

<p>
The one thing that stood out above all others
was that Potbelly's recognition of the ring had
been in vain, that Sara Helmuth had absolutely
no confidence in it, and had a very lively suspicion
that he and Krausz were attempting to trick her.
</p>

<p>
But what about?  It was no longer a question
of this woman being a prig&mdash;Hammer saw deeper
than that, at least.  There was something
underlying it all that vitally affected her.
</p>

<p>
This much he knew: Krausz had sent her certain
papers in a black wallet from the hotel in London,
and she had given those papers to Solomon five
minutes later, doubtless without reading them.
Then Solomon had lied to him about the black
wallet, and he had done it artistically, too.  The
American began to consider Solomon seriously.
</p>

<p>
"I'll bet a dollar I was right about Schlak's
murder," he thought suddenly.  "John Solomon
put that Arab up to testifying as he did, and
whether Jenson worked the same game with
Baumgardner&mdash;say, I'll run a bluff on that big
Dutchman!"
</p>

<p>
As the idea occurred to him he looked up and
saw Baumgardner himself approaching the tent,
evidently having been sent for something by the
scientist.
</p>

<p>
Hammer laid down his pipe and waited until
the other came up to the entrance, when he quickly
brought out his revolver and covered the surprised
German.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, Baumgardner," and he made his
voice as cold and menacing as possible.  "I've a
word to say to you, my man."
</p>

<p>
Anger flitted over the other's heavy countenance,
but Hammer was in no mood to be trifled with and
showed it plainly.  The boatswain sat down.
</p>

<p>
"Now bear in mind that you're under my
authority, bos'n, and not under that of the
doctor.  No, shut your head!  I've got you to rights,
Baumgardner.  Thought you were pretty smooth,
didn't you, when you pulled off that play aboard
the yacht?  But I'm on to you, and you go back
before the German Consul, you and Jenson, and
before the British authorities.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to open up the case of Schlak's death
with a vengeance, and you'll get about two years
breaking stone on the Mombasa roads for perjury,
you and Jenson.  How does that strike you, my man?"
</p>

<p>
It struck, plain enough, and struck heavily.
Baumgardner, who was a big, black-haired type
like the doctor, stared at first in blank amazement,
but when Hammer finished, his jaw had dropped
and dismay sat in his eyes.  The American, at heart
terribly doubtful as to the outcome of his bluff,
pressed the advantage instantly.
</p>

<p>
"Now, look here, Baumgardner.  You're a good
seaman, and I'd sooner put Jenson over the road
than you.  Besides, Mr. Solomon and his Arab
friend are going the same way, so there'll be
company, and to spare.  Now tell me exactly what
Jenson said to you outside the chart-house that
night."
</p>

<p>
Baumgardner, whose heavy wits failed to come
up to the scratch, blinked.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Mr. Hammer," he responded humbly,
"he just fixed up the story with me, that was all,
and said he'd stand by me.  How did you know
about it, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"None of your business," snapped Hammer,
unutterably relieved.  "So it was a frame-up, eh?
And Solomon never had the knife to your knowledge?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir.  It belonged to Mr. Schlak."
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!  Is that so?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  The sheath was hanging on his wall,
but Mr. Jenson said to say nothing about it.  The
hands didn't know because they'd never been in
his cabin and he generally carried another."
</p>

<p>
"Then we'll land Solomon&mdash;but why did he
admit having had it?"
</p>

<p>
The other only stared dully at him, his face
pale.  The American had almost forgotten about
Sara Helmuth in the light of this amazing revelation
which his bluff had forced out of a clear sky.
</p>

<p>
He thought swiftly.  Solomon must have admitted
having had the knife in order to give better
colour to the Arab's testimony, and the cleverness
of it appalled Hammer, who had scarcely expected
such astuteness from the fat supercargo.
</p>

<p>
Now, however, he determined to carry out the
affair to the limit.  He would take Baumgardner
and Jenson back to Mombasa, get hold of Solomon
and the Arab, which could easily be done, and set
the whole group breaking stone with the possible
exception of the boatswain, who had been a mere
tool in Jenson's hands.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the pallid-faced secretary was turning
out to be a dangerous character.  The American's
dislike of him was being well verified, and he
would have to keep a good watch on the viperish
little black-clad man on the trip to Melindi, where
the district commissioner could take him in charge.
</p>

<p>
But while he was turning the matter over in
his mind, Baumgardner, perhaps suspecting that
the American had bluffed the truth out of him,
was regaining his lost self-control, and now spoke
out with startling boldness.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to see Dr. Krausz, Mr. Hammer,
before taking us back.  I'm working for him&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You shut your head!"  Hammer shoved the
revolver back into his pocket, for he much preferred
to use his fists, and his face, dangerously
alight, shot forward almost into the German's.
</p>

<p>
"Don't give me any of your lip or I'll show you
who you're working for, you pie-faced Dutchman!
Now stay where you are while I fetch Jenson, and
we'll be off for Melindi in ten minutes.  You leave
this affair to me and I'll pull you out of it; but
start any monkey-work and I'll make it hot for
you.  Don't forget that."
</p>

<p>
Baumgardner was thoroughly subdued and showed
no sign of giving further trouble.  So Hammer,
determining to get off in the launch before the
afternoon grew old, called one of the boys who was
in sight.
</p>

<p>
"You talk English?  Good.  Break out two chop-boxes
and put them aboard the launch&mdash;where is
she, Baumgardner?"
</p>

<p>
"Anchored a quarter-mile off shore, sir.  The
boat's on the beach.  It's too shallow to run her in
closer, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Very good.  Boy, what's your name?"
</p>

<p>
"Mohammed Bari, sar."
</p>

<p>
"Then get a couple of boys down to the boat
with the boxes and stay here.  Be ready to lead
me down there.  That's all.  How far is the shore
from here, bos'n?"
</p>

<p>
"Straight down, sir, about three hundred yards.
But we come by a path, sir, which goes down to
the boat.  It's a matter of a half-mile."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  You stay where you are."
</p>

<p>
So, having no more fears that the boatswain
would prove insubordinate, Hammer rummaged
around in the effects of Dr. Krausz until he found
a length of very serviceable wire-twisted cord
which would make a good substitute for handcuffs.
He was going to take no chances with Adolf Jenson.
A moment later he started for the hill.  With one
of the sailors to accompany them and fetch back
the launch from Melindi, he could take care of
Jenson.  He found Krausz and the secretary at their
table beneath the sun-shelter, and perhaps
something in his eye warned the latter, for Jenson
started to his feet as Hammer came up.
</p>

<p>
"You're coming back to Mombasa with me,
Jenson," said the American, reaching forward
and dragging the fellow out bodily by the collar.
"Stick out your hands, you little beast!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Was ist?</i>"  The doctor's voice was very gentle,
but Hammer felt a little rim of steel touching his
neck.  "Let that man go please, yess?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
IN THE OPEN
</h3>

<p>
Cyrus Hammer had never felt a revolver-muzzle
against the back of his neck before, and the touch
was decidedly unpleasant.  It sent a peculiar cold
chill quivering down the length of his spine, and
there was an odd note in the doctor's voice which
sent the same kind of a chill through his brain.
</p>

<p>
In no sense was the American a coward, but he
had seen enough of life to have grasped an
extremely difficult accomplishment&mdash;that of knowing
when a man is in cold earnest, from the mere tone
of his voice.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Krausz was just at present in earnest, and
therefore Hammer loosened his grip on Jenson
and tossed his length of cord on the table; there
had swiftly leaped into his mind a premonition
that he had overlooked the most difficult part of
the proposition&mdash;by name, Dr. Sigurd Krausz.
</p>

<p>
"Now will you please explain, Mr. Hammer."
</p>

<p>
So Hammer explained, and the manner of his
explanation was not calculated to soothe the
doctor's feelings or those of Jenson, who had
shrunk back beside his protector.  The American
was angry, and three years on cattle-boats give an
angry man a vocabulary which is little short of
being extraordinary.
</p>

<p>
When he made an end, Jenson, with his rat-like
snarl, was clinging to the scientist like a frightened
child, while Krausz, his revolver put aside, was
looking at Hammer with an ominous glint in his
black eyes.  Over his temple that peculiar strip of
muscle was pounding furiously with every throb
of blood.
</p>

<p>
"So, Baumgardner hass confessed, no?"  The
doctor's voice was fairly athrill with hostility,
though the words came calmly enough.  "And
on the word of a drunken sailor you would deprive
me of my helper when I need him most?"
</p>

<p>
Hammer flushed.  "Your assistant is in her
tent down there, doctor," he said significantly.
"And, by the way, I had a talk with her this
afternoon.  No, I'm not doing this on the word
of any drunken sailor, doctor, but that fellow
Jenson is going over the road, and you may as
well make up your mind to it.  Either he or John
Solomon knows who killed Hans Schlak, and I'm
going to find out."
</p>

<p>
There was no mistaking the rage that flashed
out into the heavy eyes, but it was directed against
Jenson, as if the name of the murdered mate had
aroused a slumbering ferocity within the big
Saxon.
</p>

<p>
"So!" he spoke slowly, looking down at Jenson
with terrible quiet, only that ribbon of muscle
betraying his emotion.  "So?  And whoever killed
Hans Schlak, it wass he who took that paper
from me when I wass drunk, yess.  I do know
Adolf Jenson.  I did not suspect that it wass
you or that it wass Mr. Solomon, but if it was
you, Adolf, you shall be very sorry, yess!"
</p>

<p>
Until now poor Jenson had trembled in silence,
but he looked up and caught the full gaze of Krausz,
and it was as if something in the heavy powerful
face had blasted the last remnants of courage
within him.  He buried his face with a muffled
scream.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't!  I lied because Mr. Hammer and
Solomon were friends&mdash;they both hated me&mdash;don't
look at me like that, Herr Doctor!  Before God,
I didn't take the paper!"
</p>

<p>
It struck Hammer as odd that the taking of
that paper seemed more important to Jenson than
the murder of Schlak.  However, he had to ascertain
what the attitude of the archaeologist was to be.
</p>

<p>
"See here, doctor, I want to do the square thing,
but you can't stand up for this man.  He's perjured
himself in court and he's got to explain it.  Of
course, I can't scrap you and your men&mdash;for these
Germans will stand by you&mdash;but what I can and
will do is to go back to Melindi and send the
district commissioner up here for Jenson.  If you
persist in sticking up for him you'll get into
hot water, that's all."
</p>

<p>
Krausz looked at him calmly.
</p>

<p>
"Do not get excited, Mr. Hammer!  I am not
sticking up for anyone; but Adolf cannot go back
to Mombasa, just yet.  Later, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Jenson pulled away from him suddenly, looking
up with his viperish snarl.
</p>

<p>
"If you let them take me, Herr Doctor, I'll
tell&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
With brutal force the Saxon's hand struck down,
caught Jenson square in the mouth, and knocked
him under the table, where he lay whimpering.
Hammer was startled at the change in the face
of the man; its glossed-over brutality was standing
out in full relief, its heavy eyes were filled with
rage, its finely-chiselled mouth was convulsed with
untrammelled passion.
</p>

<p>
"Pig!  Dog!  Be quiet!" bellowed the doctor
threateningly, then turned to the American.  "As
for you, Mr. Hammer, of what did you talk with
the <i>fräulein</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Eh?  The professor?  Why, we&mdash;say, I can't
see where that's any of your business, doctor.
You'd better attend to the matter in hand and
quit using your fists on that poor devil.  Now,
speak up, for I don't intend to hang around these
diggings all afternoon.  Are you going to hand
Jenson over to me, or not?"
</p>

<p>
"My friend, I do not like your tone.  Remember
that I am your employer, yess.  When I ask you a
question I expect it to answered be."
</p>

<p>
The two men glared at each other across the
table, beneath which lay the prostrate figure of
Jenson.  From behind them came an occasional
guttural exclamation from one of the seamen-overseers,
and the ring of pick or shovel on stone;
if the scene beneath the grass-thatch was observed,
it passed unnoticed.
</p>

<p>
And beyond was the jungle and forest, deep,
silent, tropical; behind, the tents and brush huts,
the jungle again, and then the blue sea.
</p>

<p>
It may have been that a breath of bracing salt
air drifted in from the sea at his back, but Hammer
felt unaccountably stubborn on a sudden.  He
closed his fists, and was aware of the silver ring
setting a bit tightly around his little finger.
</p>

<p>
"I feel the same way about it, exactly," was
his dry response, and there was danger in his
level grey eyes.  "I asked you what you were
going to do about Jenson, doctor, and I'm waiting
for my answer."
</p>

<p>
He saw the burly hand tighten on the revolver,
and the ribbon of muscle deepened with the flush
that swept across the face of Krausz at his words;
he saw the figure under the table change its position
slightly; he saw one of the German seamen
painstakingly explain to a group of natives how to
handle their picks properly; but all the while
he was gazing steadily into the black eyes of the
scientist, waiting for the latter's decision.
</p>

<p>
Then the affair was taken out of his hands.
</p>

<p>
For, being trained thus to see many things
while looking only at one thing, the American
caught a glint of something bright beneath the table.
</p>

<p>
With his nerves on edge as they were, he shied
at the thing as a horse shies at a newspaper, and
well it was for him that he did so.
</p>

<p>
Barely had he shifted his position when a splash
of red ripped out in the shadow of the table, something
sang viciously an inch from his ear and whined
up through the grass thatch, and he realized that
Adolf Jenson had made answer for himself.
</p>

<p>
Hammer never attempted to excuse what happened
next, though he was never very sorry over it.
Comprehending in a flash that Jenson had fired
at him, and that Dr. Krausz stood waiting,
revolver in hand, he tackled the more dangerous
opponent first, even without provocation.
</p>

<p>
The scientist's face was dawning with surprise,
for he had evidently not been expecting Jenson's
move, when Hammer's fist caught him squarely
in the chin.
</p>

<p>
Hammer had no time to waste blows, and
Krausz went down without a word.  Almost in the
same movement the American jerked up the table
with his knee, exposing Jenson, and stamped hard
on the wrist which was pulling up the revolver once
more.
</p>

<p>
Jenson screamed once, and then again as Hammer's
kick took him in the stomach and doubled
him up gasping.  Already, however, Krausz was
struggling to his feet, and the American jumped
for him, raging.
</p>

<p>
Even in his anger he could not strike a man who
was down, though he had not hesitated to put the
treacherous Jenson out of commission.  He caught
the doctor's revolver hand in both his own,
wrestled away the weapon with a savage twist that
brought a grunt from the Saxon, then picked up
the automatic dropped by Jenson and sprang back.
</p>

<p>
The six seamen were coming on the double-quick,
drawn by the shots and Jenson's screams,
and the American knew that he had his work cut
out for him.
</p>

<p>
"Down with you, Krausz," he cried, his voice
high.  The doctor, raising himself on one elbow,
cursed, but obeyed, while Jenson writhed in the
dust and whimpered.  Across their bodies Hammer
levelled the two revolvers and waited.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" he said more calmly as three of the
seamen came up together.  "You, Schmidt, and
Klaus, pick up that rope there and tie Mr. Jenson's
hands behind his back.  Behind his back, remember,
and do it so that I can see the knots.  The rest of
you stay where you are."
</p>

<p>
Krausz raised his voice in a storm of furious
curses, but the six seamen were used to taking
orders from Hammer, and after a look into the
two revolvers they obeyed him promptly if sullenly.
</p>

<p>
"Stop that silly cursing, doctor," commanded
the American, now sure of himself.  The cursing
stopped, though the doctor's face was not a pleasant
sight, what with his fury and a trickle of blood from
a cut lip.
</p>

<p>
By this time the two sailors had jerked Jenson
to his feet and were trying his hands as Hammer had
directed, the other four men standing back and
staring from the doctor to the American in
stupefied wonder.  Already, however, Hammer was
making his plans as how to get away.
</p>

<p>
If he took Jenson and Baumgardner and started
for the beach the doctor and his six men would be
after him instantly.  The natives did not count;
Hammer had learned enough from the doctor to
know that there was nothing to fear from these
Kiswahili.  Then there was Baumgardner to be
considered&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You want help, sar?"
</p>

<p>
Hammer glanced hurriedly over his shoulder at
the gentle voice.  There, to his infinite amazement,
he beheld the grinning features of Potbelly; also
the submission of Dr. Krausz was explained, since
Potbelly held him under the muzzle of his own
shotgun, and appeared to be enjoying himself
immensely.
</p>

<p>
The American remembered suddenly that he
could not take to his heels and leave Sara Helmuth
in the lurch, though he had forgotten all about her.
And that he would be leaving her in the lurch he
had no doubt whatever.
</p>

<p>
"Did Professor Helmuth send you up here?"
he asked crisply.  Potbelly grinned.
</p>

<p>
"No, sar.  I hear <i>bang-bang</i>, take gun belonging
to <i>Bwana Doctor</i>, come quick."
</p>

<p>
There seemed to be no doubt of his antagonism
to the Saxon, so Hammer accepted the fact without
trying to explain it.
</p>

<p>
"All right.  You stay here.  If the <i>Bwana</i> Doctor
or his men try to follow me, shoot.  Get that?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Jambo, Bwana</i>," came the assured answer.
</p>

<p>
"Come over here, Jenson&mdash;move lively, you
hound, or I'll come and kick you over!"
</p>

<p>
Hammer's grim voice fetched the cowering
secretary, whose arms were fast bound behind
him.  Throwing away the automatic, which he did
not understand, the American put the doctor's
revolver into his vacant coat-pocket and grabbed
Jenson by the shoulder, accelerating his progress
as he turned.
</p>

<p>
Beneath, he could see Mohammed Bari and
Baumgardner standing, watching, beside the tent.
He was not ready for them, however, but paused
outside Professor Helmuth's canvas, drawing out
one of his revolvers in order to keep the boatswain
safely lined up.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Helmuth!" he called.  "Get out here, quick!"
</p>

<p>
A second later the tent-flap was pulled aside and
he saw the girl standing, her revolver in her hand.
Her eyes widened in amazement at sight of him
standing over the figure of Jenson.
</p>

<p>
"Get what necessities you must take, and do
it in a hurry, please.  Potbelly's holding the doctor
up there with the shotgun, and we'll have to
make tracks for the launch.  Don't stop to argue,
but for Heaven's sake get a move on if you want to
skip out of here!"
</p>

<p>
He caught one muttered exclamation of something
that sounded very much like "Thank God!"
and she vanished.  It was curious, thought Hammer,
that while she had twice repulsed him that same
day, with varied degrees of suspicion, she now did
as he commanded without a word of protest.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps Potbelly had something to do with
it, or else the sight of Jenson in bonds had influenced
her to believe him sincere at last.
</p>

<p>
He eyed Baumgardner grimly, and, deciding
to make the big boatswain of some use, ordered him
to take charge of Jenson.
</p>

<p>
"If he gets away, one of you will stop a bullet,"
he concluded.  "You go first and lead the way,
Mohammed Bari."
</p>

<p>
The Kiswahili grinned, nodding cheerfully and
seeming in no wise affected by the display of
revolvers by these white men, to whose vagaries he was
accustomed.  Looking up at the hill, the American
could see the tableau beneath the grass-thatch
very clearly.
</p>

<p>
Potbelly stood with the shotgun at his shoulder,
covering Krausz, who still lay on the ground, his
heavy curses carrying down to the tents, and behind
him stood the six seamen in a bunch.
</p>

<p>
"I guess that nigger's competent," chuckled
Hammer to himself.  "Wonder what he knows about
my friend John Solomon?"
</p>

<p>
His wonder vanished before the necessity for
action, as Professor Helmuth appeared at the
entrance to her tent, a small wicker suitcase in
her hand.  Hammer took it as she reached his
side, and motioned her to fall in ahead of him.
</p>

<p>
"Go ahead, Mohammed," he said.  "You next,
bos'n, with Jenson&mdash;no, you go with Mohammed,
professor; I want to keep an eye on these two
beauties.  I guess Potbelly can take care of his
own getaway."
</p>

<p>
The girl made no protest, but joined the native,
and all five left the camp and the staring Kiswahili
behind.  A last backward glance showed Hammer
that Potbelly was slowly retreating down the hill,
and then the jungle had closed in about him and all
behind was lost to sight, with only the green tangle
on every hand and the backs of Baumgardner and
Jenson in front, while through the shadow-haunted,
sun-creeping mass of foliage came to him occasional
glints of the white dress of Professor Helmuth.
</p>

<p>
Cyrus Hammer felt quite pleased with himself
for once.  He had bearded the lion in his den and had
got clean off with the bone&mdash;meaning Jenson.
As to Sara Helmuth, that was another matter and
not one with which Hammer was not now greatly
concerned.  If she had been in trouble, she was out
of it, and enough said.
</p>

<p>
But Jenson was going over the road, the American
told himself grimly.  To tell the truth, he was angry,
more because the pallid little secretary had played
with him than because he had committed perjury,
and he was now intent on reopening the case of
Schlak.  Either Jenson or Solomon could tell who
had killed the second mate, and why there had been
a double perjury afterward.
</p>

<p>
As they tramped along, stumbling over vines
and creepers, with the jungle wall dark and
impenetrable on either hand, Hammer caught the two
men ahead talking, and warned them against it
with such savage intensity in his voice that they
obeyed.
</p>

<p>
The American was perfectly well aware of the
dangerous quality of the secretary by this time,
and was surprised that Dr. Krausz had stood up
for the man so boldly, even to defying the law.
</p>

<p>
For that matter, Krausz was apt to prove
extremely dangerous himself, now that his open
antagonism must have been aroused.
</p>

<p>
Hammer chuckled at the delight which had been
so evident in the face of Potbelly.
</p>

<p>
The fellow had the quality, rare in natives, of
acting on his own initiative, and the American
hoped that he would get away in safety from the
German party.
</p>

<p>
Undoubtedly he owed Potbelly's help to the
little silver ring, however&mdash;and that was a mark
in John Solomon's favour.
</p>

<p>
But had Solomon really sent him the ring, and
why?  It seemed a senseless thing for a supercargo&mdash;ah!
If Potbelly had recognized it, what connection
had he with John Solomon, and where was the
link between Solomon and Sara Helmuth?
</p>

<p>
"It's too blamed deep for me," concluded
Hammer, eyeing Baumgardner's broad back and the
narrow cringing shoulders of the secretary.  "Best
thing I can do is to see Harcourt and soak this devil
Jenson before the doctor gets back to fire me&mdash;which
same he won't get a chance to do if I know it!"
</p>

<p>
It had been his original plan to bring one of the
German sailors who could take back the launch
from Melindi, for the convenience of Dr. Krausz.
This did not matter greatly to Hammer now, however,
so he concluded that when they reached Melindi
they could find out about the Protectorate
despatch-boat <i>Juba</i>, the only ship which made the place.
</p>

<p>
If she was about due they could wait for her, and
if not they could easily run the sixty-five miles
down to Mombasa&mdash;which, however, would be
longer by coast, for the launch was a small one,
and Hammer would not chance a squall very far
from shore.
</p>

<p>
After an excessively long fifteen minutes the
American, who was half-fearful of treachery on
the part of Mohammed Bari, the guide, saw the
welcome gleam of water ahead, and they stepped
out from the trees to the sand, almost without
warning, for the jungle ended as suddenly as it began.
</p>

<p>
Below them lay the surf-boat, with the two boys
indolently lying under the thwarts, and Mohammed
Bari was already stirring them to action with his
foot and tongue.  A white speck out beyond the
lines of heavy ground-swell surf showed the launch
at anchor.
</p>

<p>
Hammer marched his captive Jenson and his
semicaptive Baumgardner down to the boat without
heeding Sara Helmuth, who was watching anxiously.
Dropping the suitcase to the sand, which was alive
with sand-fleas, he addressed the boatswain sternly.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Baumgardner, if Jenson has been putting
any treachery into your head you forget it quick.
Get up in the bow of that boat when she goes out,
and then get into the bow of the launch and take
care of Jenson.  If his bonds are loosened or if you
try any tricks, I'll give you a bullet first, so mind
that.  All ready, Miss Helmuth?"
</p>

<p>
She assented silently, and he helped her into
the stern-sheets of the boat, the boys waiting to
run it out.  Ordering the two to return after they
made the launch and Mohammed Bari to remain
with him, he sent the two Germans into the bow,
then lent a hand at running out the boat.
</p>

<p>
A moment later he flung himself in over the
stern, the dripping boys took an oar each, and they
headed through the slow swells of breaking surf
for the launch.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
HAMMER BEGINS TO SEE
</h3>

<p>
Not until reaching the launch did Jenson, who
was almost beside himself with terror,
seem to realize that Dr. Krausz had been powerless
to save him from Hammer.
</p>

<p>
As Baumgardner tried to put him over the side
he broke away, and flung himself face downward
across the fore thwarts of the boat with whimpering,
inarticulate cries.
</p>

<p>
The American caught Baumgardner's helpless
gaze and ordered Mohammed to hold the two craft
together while he attended to Jenson.
</p>

<p>
At this juncture, however, Sara Helmuth developed
resources of her own.  Motioning to Hammer
to hold on, she calmly took a revolver from his
coat-pocket, rose, and went forward.
</p>

<p>
"Get into the launch, Baumgardner," she said
coldly, and the man obeyed.  Jenson looked up at
her, then fell to grovelling at her feet.
</p>

<p>
"Don't shoot!" he shrieked, a mad agony of fear
in his voice.  "I'll tell it all, <i>fräulein</i>&mdash;it was I
who told the Herr Doctor about the&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Be silent!" she said scornfully, and his
whimperings died away.  "Get into that launch unless
you want to be thrown in."
</p>

<p>
To the surprise of Hammer, the secretary
clambered into the launch without a word more, and
she followed him.  When the chop-boxes had been
put aboard and Mohammed Bari had followed
them, Hammer went over the side also and curtly
ordered the two boys to row back to the shore.
</p>

<p>
"Do you understand this engine, Miss Helmuth?"
he asked meekly.  Since this girl from California
had shown herself adept at so many other things,
it was more than possible that she could take care
of the launch engine, so that he was not surprised
when she nodded, handed back the revolver, and
stooped over the fly-wheel.
</p>

<p>
An adjustment of oil and gasoline pins, and with
the first crank the engine went off into a steady
splutter that rose to a roar beneath her hand.
</p>

<p>
Hammer made room for her in the stern-sheets
and took the tiller-ropes himself, for the launch
steered from a wheel at the bow, with another
amidships, but he could easily steer by the ropes
from the stern.
</p>

<p>
"Baumgardner, get up that anchor.  Help him,
Mohammed."
</p>

<p>
The boat rocked as the little anchor was torn
loose and then swung away.  By the time the
boatswain had got the anchor in-board the launch was
standing down the coast: looking back, Hammer
could see nothing save jungle, over which the sun
was lowering redly, for the afternoon was hard
upon its close.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's good-bye to the doctor and his ruins,"
he said cheerfully to the girl at his side.  To his
amazement, he saw a mist in her eyes; then she
turned and looked at him, her hand extended.
</p>

<p>
"I ask your pardon, Mr. Hammer."
</p>

<p>
The touch of her cool hand thrilled him, but
before he could speak she went on, her voice low.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry that I misjudged you so terribly,
but under the circumstances I was unable to trust
anyone.  Then, when I heard the shots and came
came out to see you with Adolf tied up, I knew that
Potbelly had been right after all, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And so you came," he finished gravely as she
paused.  "I do not understand, Miss Helmuth, as I
told you before, but I am just as glad as you are to
leave that place behind."
</p>

<p>
"I'm&mdash;I'm not glad," she faltered, looking
away from him, and he could see that her eyelids
were closing and unclosing rapidly, as if to quench
tears that welled forth.  "It was my father's
dream&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He leaned forward to throw off the motor, but
she recognized his intention and checked his hand
swiftly.
</p>

<p>
"No, no&mdash;you misunderstand, Mr. Hammer!
Please, let me think a moment!  I'll try to tell
you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, please don't tell me anything that
distresses you, Miss Helmuth.  I am very sorry that
circumstances brought us together in the way they
did, but everything's coming all right now, so
don't worry.  This boat isn't very fast, but we
ought to pick up the Melindi light an hour after
dark at furthest."
</p>

<p>
"What do you intend to do with Adolf Jenson,
Mr. Hammer?"  She turned and faced him, and
now her brown eyes seemed very determined once
more with the passing of her momentary weakness.
</p>

<p>
So Hammer told her the story of how Hans
Schlak had died unavenged, and of necessity
began at the beginning with John Solomon's
arrival at "Prince's" in search of a job.
</p>

<p>
She listened with grave intentness, only smiling
once, when he told about that hurried trip to
the departing <i>Mombasa</i> at London, then sitting
and watching his face.  Hammer himself could
give but a divided interest to the story, since he
had to tell it and watch the coast at the same
time, until it occurred to him to order
Baumgardner to handle the yacht from the wheel
forward.
</p>

<p>
He also ordered Mohammed to break out the
chop-boxes and dish up as good a meal for all
as their contents would afford.  Then, leaning
back, he filled his pipe and finished his story.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, smoke all you want to," she smiled
at his inquiring look.  "Have you always been a
sailor, Mr. Hammer?"
</p>

<p>
"Eh?  Well, not exactly," he returned, flushing,
and hesitated for a bare second.  "I've been
working on cattle-boats for three years past."
</p>

<p>
"Well, isn't that being a sailor?" she laughed
back.  Hammer looked sharply at her, and found
that she meant the words.  Evidently she knew
nothing of cattle-boats.
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly, Miss Helmuth.  It means that
one associates with thugs and the lowest sort of
men, and in general stands for ostracism among
decent people."
</p>

<p>
"Then why did you tell me that?"
</p>

<p>
"Because you asked me."
</p>

<p>
Hammer felt, indeed, as though she had drawn
the truth from him bodily, and the earnestness
of his tone perhaps startled her, for she looked
out toward the east, where the after-glow was
striking the skies to crimson; and when finally
she spoke it was with entire abandonment of the
subject, much to the American's relief.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hammer, I wish I had trusted you in the
first place.  Do you know, I do think that
Mr. Solomon sent you that ring for the very purpose
of making me trust you?  No, wait a minute,
please!  I haven't anyone else to depend on, and
if I told you my story I think it would help me a
great deal.  You see, I've been rather wrought
up for the past few days&mdash;in fact, ever since
Dr. Krausz arrived."
</p>

<p>
Hammer nodded quietly.  "I'll respect the
confidence, of course, Miss Helmuth.  And if I
can be of any assistance, you may command me."
</p>

<p>
She seemed not to have heard the words, for
she was gazing off toward the darkening coastline,
lost in thought.  He watched her firm, well-poised
features for a moment while he lit his pipe,
and as the match hissed in the water alongside,
she turned decisively to him.
</p>

<p>
Hammer stopped her, telling Mohammed to
get out the launch's lights and set them in their
sockets, then settled back and listened without
comment.
</p>

<p>
"You'll pardon me for going into my own
history, Mr. Hammer, but it's necessary here.
My father was an archaeologist connected with
the University of California, though he was usually
afield, and as I accompanied him ever since my
mother's death, ten years ago, you can see how
I come to recognize your Arabic expressions yesterday."
</p>

<p>
Hammer grinned to himself, for there was a
suspicion of dry humour in the girl's voice, and
he knew that he was forgiven.
</p>

<p>
"Last year my father and Dr. Krausz were
together in Greece, while I was preparing to take
up work at Dresden Library.  Mr. Hammer, what
happened on that trip has never been discovered.
I received a very hasty letter from my father,
dated at Lisbon on his return to Germany, and
this was followed by the news of his death.
Dr. Krausz brought his body home, for we were living
in Dresden, temporarily.
</p>

<p>
"In his letter my father had merely said that
he was not well but had made a great discovery,
and if anything happened to him I should write
to Mr. John Solomon, a friend of his at Port
Said, to whom he had already written in full.
At the time I thought nothing of it, though I
believe that he had some presentiment of his death;
nor did I distrust Dr. Krausz when&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious, girl!" snapped out Hammer,
startled.  "You don't mean to say that Krausz
was responsible for your&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, no!  Wait, please!"  She laid a hand on
his arm, withdrawing it instantly.  "You see,
father's death was a dreadful shock to me, and
then I had to straighten up all his affairs besides
going on with my work at the library.  So I
forgot all about father's discovery and writing
this Mr. Solomon.  There was no mention of
such a man in his papers which Dr. Krausz turned
over to me&mdash;after keeping some of them, as I now
know."
</p>

<p>
"Then Krausz is not your guardian, as he
told me?" broke in the American.  In response
to the girl's surprised glance he told her of the
doctor's words.
</p>

<p>
"No; that was all a lie, Mr. Hammer.  Of course,
I never suspected that anything was wrong, for I
used to see a good deal of him in Dresden, where
he stayed to work on a book.  Well, about three
months ago he came to me offering me this position
of assistant to him.  I was naturally quite flattered,
for he is really a big man in the world of science,
Mr. Hammer, and of course I accepted.  He told
me only that he had found out about this place,
and, as usual, I waited to be taken into his
confidence when the time came.
</p>

<p>
"Well, while I was clearing things up at home
I found father's letter, and it occurred to me
that since I had to pass through Port Said I might
as well write to this Mr. Solomon and ask him
about father's discovery.  I did so, and in return
received a long cable telling me to say nothing
to Dr. Krausz, but to trust implicitly in whoever
showed me the letter I had written Mr. Solomon.
</p>

<p>
"I waited for the messenger, but none came
until that day in London when the steamer was
leaving.  Then a fat little man with queer blue
eyes rushed up, showed me the letter, and demanded
the papers which the doctor had just sent me.
Since the purser had directed him to me and there
was no time to waste, I obeyed, although the
papers contained directions as to what I was to
do in the preliminary work.  Fortunately, he
cabled me their contents at Mombasa."
</p>

<p>
"The thing sounds incredible, Miss Helmuth,"
said Hammer, as she paused, "but I rather think
that there is more in it than we know.  Solomon
certainly must be more than a mere supercargo&mdash;and
say, he sure handed Krausz a hot one!"
</p>

<p>
Whereupon he told her about Solomon's mention
of having worked for a Professor Helmuth in
Palestine.  She smiled sadly.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't finished yet, Mr. Hammer.  It&mdash;oh!
What's that?  It's just like a lighthouse!"
</p>

<p>
Hammer turned to see a tiny dot of light against
the coast to the south-west, and nodded.
</p>

<p>
"The Melindi light&mdash;stationary white light,
Miss Helmuth.  We're miles away yet."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I got here and got the work started after
a fashion.  I thought it was awfully queer that
Mr. Solomon had acted the way he did, but father
spoke very warmly of him in his last letter, and
father had some queer friends all over the world.
Things went on very well until Dr. Krausz and
Jenson came the other day.  The first evening
the doctor drank a good deal of champagne, and
he said some things that startled me, in connection
with the expedition.
</p>

<p>
"Then, the second day, I went to his tent while
he was on the hill, in order to get some quinine.
As I passed his table I saw a sheet of paper on
the floor and stooped to pick it up; you can imagine
the shock it gave me to see my father's handwriting!
Then I saw that it was something about
this place&mdash;Fort St. Thomas, it was called&mdash;and
the paper proved to be part of a transcription father
had made from some old document, telling about
the things buried here.
</p>

<p>
"That made me suspect Dr. Krausz of having
stolen the papers from my father.  Perhaps you
can guess, Mr. Hammer, that with archaeologists
especially, a 'find' such as this would be a terribly
big thing; it would mean not only money, but
a great deal more.  And with certain scientists,
just as with actors, it is almost a monomania
to 'have a big name'; besides, the passion for
discovering such things gets a tremendous hold
on one, all by itself.
</p>

<p>
"I was so angry that I went right up to the ruins
and asked the doctor about it.  He had been
drinking again, and instead of getting angry he
only laughed at me, telling me to prove it if I
could&mdash;and he frightened me, Mr. Hammer.  I'm
not very timid, but I think any woman is afraid
of a drunken man."
</p>

<p>
Hammer winced imperceptibly.
</p>

<p>
"I tried to get away with my boys, but he
prevented me&mdash;not openly, but so I understood
that I could not go.  Therefore I managed to
get one of my mission boys off with a note, but
he was found and brought back by a party of
Kiswahili, and the only thing I could do was to
barricade myself in my tent."
</p>

<p>
"Which you did very effectually," laughed
Hammer.  Inwardly, he was cursing Dr. Krausz
with all his soul.  "Tell me, where did you get
that boy Potbelly?  He seems to know a lot about
Solomon."
</p>

<p>
Potbelly, it appeared, had met her when she
first landed, displaying letters of recommendation
from John Solomon and others, upon which she
had promptly engaged him.  Since then he had
proven invaluable to her, though he had said
nothing of Solomon until he rushed into her tent
that afternoon, saying that Hammer had come
from that individual.
</p>

<p>
In the American's mind there was no doubt
that Krausz had been carried away by the craze
of his science, and he expressed himself forcibly
on the subject.  It occurred to him, however,
that possession was nine points of the law, and
they had no evidence on which to prosecute Krausz
for anything.  On the other hand, if he set to
work to gather in John Solomon for the perjury
committed on the yacht and in court, he would
be removing the girl's only mainstay.
</p>

<p>
Solomon had clearly been playing a smooth
game, for some undefined purpose.  Supposing
that Professor Helmuth had really written him
from Lisbon, upon receiving the letter from Sara
Helmuth telling of Dr. Krausz's expedition and
asking details of her father's discovery, he might
have leaped to the conclusion that Krausz was
crooked.
</p>

<p>
Then he had come to England for the purpose
of finding this out?  That was the question
troubling Hammer.  It Solomon had joined the
yacht merely to play Sara Helmuth's hand for
her, which seemed like incredible chivalry in
such a man, there would be a bad complication
if Solomon were arrested for perjury.
</p>

<p>
In fact, that would be the best thing in the
world for Dr. Krausz, for whoever and whatever
this Solomon was, he was certainly taking care
of everything in a remarkably shrewd manner.
</p>

<p>
Potbelly had plainly been stationed at Mombasa
to attach himself to the girl and protect her.  The
mere use by Solomon of the cables in so reckless
a manner showed that the man must have money
behind him.
</p>

<p>
Sara Helmuth went on to say that all of
Dr. Krausz's men had been with him for years, from
the giant Hans Schlak to Adolf Jenson.  It was
clear to Hammer that Krausz had received as
much of a shock as had anyone upon Schlak's
death, and he had afterward threatened Jenson
darkly, there and up on the hill.
</p>

<p>
But if the fellow knew who had killed Schlak,
why did he not tell&mdash;or had he told the truth
when he said that he had tried to fasten the crime
on Solomon because he was Hammer's friend?
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the American remembered Jenson's
cry, stopped by a brutal blow from the doctor.
"If you let them take me, Herr Doctor, I'll tell&mdash;"
what?  The secretary had started to say the same
thing as he grovelled at Sara Helmuth's feet,
and as he recalled this Hammer sprang up.
</p>

<p>
"Jenson!  Come aft here, and move spry unless
you want me to come after you."
</p>

<p>
The secretary, his hands still bound, had been
stretched out on one of the side-cushions near
Baumgardner, and at Hammer's words he got
up and shambled aft.
</p>

<p>
The American was growing less anxious with
every moment to push the investigation into
Schlak's death; at any rate before he and Miss
Helmuth had had some kind of an explanation
with John Solomon.  Once Jenson was turned
over for perjury, Solomon, the Arab, and
Baumgardner would of necessity be gathered into the
same net, while the legal complications might
be unending.  And Cyrus Hammer had both the
sailor's and the broker's fear of lawyers.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, my man," he addressed Jenson
with curt asperity, the pallid, almost corpse-like
features of the man standing out in the starlight
clearly.  Hammer noted absently that over the
shoulder of Jenson the Southern Cross hung low
above the horizon's rim.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Helmuth and I know some things, and
we want to know more, especially about your
master's dealings with Professor Helmuth in
Lisbon.  You know, and you can tell us.  If you
do, I promise you that you'll not go up before
the court for perjury, though we may hold you
for a few days aboard the yacht.  If you refuse,
then you'll take your medicine for perjury and
for your murderous attack on me.  Choose."
</p>

<p>
Jenson chose, and quickly.  He sank down in
the bottom of the boat awkwardly, because of his
bound arms, and the terror in his face was so great
that the girl turned away from him, unable to
watch longer.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell, Mr. Hammer, if&mdash;if you'll let me go."
</p>

<p>
"I promise, Jenson," said Hammer quietly.
"But mind you don't lie, for we know enough
to test the truth of your story."
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell the truth, Mr. Hammer, so help me!
Professor Helmuth was sick, and we knew that
he had found something big in one of the libraries.
I was nursing him, and when he got worse I went
through his papers one night, then took them to
the Herr Doctor who kept them.
</p>

<p>
"Professor Helmuth died, and we tried to get
hold of the original papers at the library, but
there had been an outbreak of Royalists and
everything was closed or in disorder.  So we came to
Dresden and, later, made up the expedition.  That's
all, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"And enough."  Hammer turned to Sara
Helmuth.  "Anything you would like to ask him,
Miss Helmuth?"
</p>

<p>
"No," she shuddered, looking away.  "Get
him out of my sight."
</p>

<p>
Jenson needed no urging to remove himself,
and for a space the two in the stern remained
silent, while the motor sent its staccato exhaust
humming over the sea.  The Melindi light was
very close now, and Hammer headed for the river,
since the launch was small enough to get into
the mouth of the Sabaki and make the dock.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Mr. Hammer," the girl spoke in
a low voice as she turned to him.  "So it was
that man who brought about father's betrayal!
I think that he will suffer punishment for that,
one day."
</p>

<p>
The American gave little heed to her words
at the time, but he was to remember them later,
when he and Sara Helmuth and Adolf Jenson
were facing the end of things together.
</p>

<p>
Jenson's soul seemed to Hammer as colourless
as his face.  He lay amidships, over a thwart
beyond the motor, in silence: odd, thought the
American, that while the man was a creature of
lies and theft and treachery yet he was the veriest
coward withal.
</p>

<p>
Baumgardner, who was smoking a pipe, had
also come amidships to the wheel there, while
Mohammed Bari was sitting forward, just beyond
Jenson, chewing betel and humming some
monotonous native air to himself.
</p>

<p>
The American overlooked one significant fact,
namely, that Baumgardner, as well as the other
Germans of the crew, had been with Krausz for
several years, and since the Melindi fight was now
so close he apprehended no further trouble.
</p>

<p>
He was joying in the fact that the girl's
confidence had drawn them a bit closer together,
mentally; and by that curious sixth sense which
comes to men at such moments he felt that she
also realized this, and that it was not unwelcome
to her.
</p>

<p>
He frankly was drawn by Sara Helmuth.  The
way in which she had faced the problem presented
by Dr. Krausz, her absolute independence of
thought and action, and the very manner in which
she bore herself&mdash;all these attracted the American
greatly, and he smiled as he recollected his mental
picture of this Professor Sara L. Helmuth.
</p>

<p>
Sara wasn't such a bad name alter all, he
reflected, then remembered how the doctor had spoken
of his assistant and frowned.  Dr. Krausz certainly
had something coming to him, and if he only got
the chance he was going to see that it came.
</p>

<p>
However, that could wait.  First was the
problem of John Solomon, while he and Harcourt
would have to look into Schlak's death between
them.
</p>

<p>
Mohammed Bari shifted his position and hung
over the side, lazily squirting betel juice
outboard, and as they were now opposite the Melindi
light, and a half-mile out, Hammer directed
Baumgardner to head straight in for the river
mouth.
</p>

<p>
The launch swung about, ceased her rolling
as she rose on the first surf-crest, and on a sudden
the engine gave one deep-throated, convulsive
gasp and died into silence.
</p>

<p>
"The oil&mdash;turn the oil-cocks off!" exclaimed
Sara Helmuth sharply, as Hammer rose.  "I
thought I had turned them off, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"All right, I'll fix it in a minute."
</p>

<p>
Hammer went to the engine, beside Baumgardner,
and leaned over; with the action he
received a heavy shove that sent him head first
against the second cylinder.  His head striking
the oil-cup, he felt the thing snap off, the jagged
glass and metal ripping the skin of his brow above
his left eye: for a second he was half-stunned,
but fought blindly to regain his balance, thinking
that the launch had struck a reef.  Then he was
caught from behind and half-lifted back toward
the rail, a hand closing on his throat.
</p>

<p>
As he came erect, gripping desperately at the
air, he saw the form of Jenson at one side, hands
unbound.  A flash of red split the starlight into
blackness, and Jenson, with a strange clucking
noise, dove head first over the side.
</p>

<p>
Baumgardner, who was trying to fling the
American over the rail, stumbled on a thwart,
and they both came down in a heap.
</p>

<p>
Over the port bow lay Mohammed Bari, very
still and silent, a black thread of betel juice
trickling from his mouth and something blacker
running from between his shoulder-blades where
a knife-haft gleamed.  Jenson had acted swiftly.
</p>

<p>
Thrashing about in the launch's bottom, Hammer
wrenched around and clutched the boatswain with
his left hand, forcing him back against the rail.
But his throat was dry, his breath was shut off,
and the figure of Sara Helmuth standing in the
stern, revolver in hand, was lost in a swirl of
blackness.
</p>

<p>
Vaguely, Hammer felt the fingers of his right hand
close on something hard beneath him, and with
a last effort he brought the object up and struck
the German with all his strength.
</p>

<p>
Hit squarely on the temple by the heavy wrench,
Baumgardner groaned softly and fell back with
loosened fingers, toppling slowly over the rail
until a surf-crest picked him up gently and
smothered him from sight.
</p>

<p>
Hammer lay motionless at the girl's feet, a
black-red smear over brow and eyes, while she
stood as if paralysed; and over the bow one of
Mohammed Bari's hands flopped crazily to the
lift of the surf.
</p>

<p>
And so the launch drifted slowly toward the
river-mouth and beach, with no man to guide
her.
</p>

CHAPTER X
<br /><br />
AT MELINDI
</h3>

<p>
"Dang it, I've a 'ole bloomin' 'ospital on me
'ands, what with Mr. 'Ammer as 'e is and
Mr. Harcourt on 'is beam ends!  And worse luck,
it comes just when&mdash;ah, all ready, miss?  And
what'll it be this time?"
</p>

<p>
"Whatever you say," rejoined the voice of
Sara Helmuth, grave and self-contained.  "Is
there any change in Mr. Harcourt?"
</p>

<p>
"No, miss.  'E's crying fretful like&mdash;or at
least 'e was.  Seems like a woman's step and
tongue quiets 'im a bit, miss: werry unusual,
o' course, but when so be as a man's off 'is 'ead,
I says&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Darn you, Jenson!  Stop your bally grinning!
He stabbed me, I tell you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Harcourt's shrill cry pierced through the low-toned
voices and sent cold sweat starting on Cyrus
Hammer's brow as he stared up into darkness.
</p>

<p>
Where was he?  What was this terror that had
seized on Harcourt?  For answer the soft murmur
of Sara Helmuth's soothing voice came to him,
followed by the wheeze of a harmonica.
</p>

<p>
"All right, miss, I've got me instrument in
ship-shape order, so to speak.  Let's give 'em
that 'ere lullaby you was a-singing of last night,
miss&mdash;them Irish things fair brings the music out
o' me, though bein' born and bred in Wapping
I ain't got much use for the Irish in general.
But let 'er go, miss; I'll come in somewheres."
</p>

<p>
Silence for a moment; then the girl's voice
rose&mdash;a soft, deep-toned contralto, with Solomon
"coming in somewheres" with his harmonica in a
monotone accompaniment which did well enough,
however, and must have satisfied him amazingly.
Hammer's eyes glistened as the words came sweetly
to him, for the words and air brought many things
back to him, things that he thought long forgotten&mdash;&mdash;

<p>
"Dang it&mdash;'e's asleep&mdash;excuse me, miss, while
I see to Mr. 'Ammer."
</p>

<p>
Solomon's voice was husky and jerky, and the
American, who felt much the same way himself,
saw a flood of light spread through his darkness
for a moment.  A step sounded, and Solomon
dropped into a creaking chair beside Hammer.
</p>

<p>
"Dang it," came a mutter, "I didn't 'ave the
'eart to tell 'er, bless 'er sweet face!  'E's done
for, 'e is, and 'ere I be, tied up wi' the missus
and the two on 'em while that danged pasty-faced
scoundrel's been and got clean off.  But
wait, me friend!  Them as stabs in the dark
shall perish in the dark, as the Good Book says;
but when I gets me 'ands on 'im&mdash;Lud!  So you've
been and woke up, Mr. 'Ammer?"
</p>

<p>
The American, wondering what sort of nightmare
he was passing through, had raised his hand and
felt a thick bandage around his head, and the
movement had startled Solomon from his soliloquy.
</p>

<p>
Despite the bandage and his bewilderment,
Hammer felt very well, and announced that
fact as he tried to sit up.  Solomon's hand repressed
him.
</p>

<p>
"Down wi' you, if you please, sir!  It's still
a-workin' in you, but to-morrow morning you'll
be fit to&mdash;Lud help us all!  If 'e don't last&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If who doesn't last?" queried Hammer, lying
back among his pillows.  "Who is it that's done
for?"
</p>

<p>
"You've 'ad a sleeping potion, Mr. 'Ammer,"
came Solomon's reply, a curious note in the man's
voice.  "It's been and give you bad dreams, sir,
so just drink this, and in the morning&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Obediently, Hammer swallowed a few drops
from the spoon that Solomon held to his mouth, and
still wondering what the conversation had been
all about, slipped off into slumber before he could
speak his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
He woke to find it broad daylight.  He was
lying on a mosquito-curtained cot beside an open
window, and gained a glimpse of green trees and
white-boiled cotton-fields before he turned his
head to inspect his quarters.  For a space the
wonder of the thing gripped him, keeping him
from recalling what had last taken place.
</p>

<p>
He had gone to sleep in an open launch off the
Sabaki River, and he had wakened in a room
that might have housed a prince.  Save for his
cot and a small stand of plain ebony beside it
that held medicines, there was no furniture in
the room but rugs&mdash;rugs on walls and floor, and
ceiling, even.  Though knowing nothing of such
things, the American sensed the fact that they
were such rugs as he had never seen before.
</p>

<p>
Opposite him was a royal Ispahan prayer-rug
of solid fawn and blue silk, with unbroken lines
of Arabic worked in solid gold thread, and the
cypress, the tree of life, rising over all in white.
</p>

<p>
On another wall beside the one door hung a
rug of pale-blues and yellows, bearing the
five-clawed dragon of the imperial family of China;
it could have come from no place save the imperial
palace, so much Hammer knew.
</p>

<p>
These were but two of the many which struck
his eye in that first moment, and utterly
bewildered, he sat up, feeling slightly dizzy
but perfectly sound, save for a slight pain in his
head.  As he sat, a voice came to him; at first
he took it for Harcourt's, then recognized his
error.
</p>

<p>
"I have notified the authorities, Mr. Solomon,
as you wished, and have no doubt that all will
be right as far as you are concerned.  No, I am
sorry that there is no hope whatever; this bally
fever has complicated the thing, don't you know,
and I am frank to say that I can do nothing.  He'll
be conscious for an hour or so before&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The voice died away, and Hammer sat staring
dumbly at the Ming dragon, for now he recalled
that wild dream he had had.  What was going
on here, anyway?  Where was he?
</p>

<p>
Suddenly conscious of hunger and a feverish
thirst, he seized a glass of water from the ebony
stand and drained it.  As he set it down the door
opened, and into the room came John Solomon,
holding open the door for Sara Helmuth,
pale-faced but steady-eyed as ever.
</p>

<p>
He could do nothing but stare at them blankly,
Solomon, his pudgy face very pale, heaped up
a large rug for the girl at the head of the bed;
and as she sat down she looked up at Hammer
with a smile, but it was a smile that struck a cold
fear to his heart.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" he asked hoarsely.  "For
Heaven's sake talk!"
</p>

<p>
"You tell him, Mr. Solomon," and there was a
catch in the girl's voice.  Solomon nodded and
sank down on a rug with his legs crossed: Hammer
noted absent-mindedly that he wore dingy
carpet-slippers and held his empty clay-pipe in one
hand.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. 'Ammer, sir," the supercargo cleared his
throat, "let me say first as 'ow you're all right,
or will be after a bit, though you've been off
your 'ead for a matter o' three days.  You're
in my own 'ouse, sir, and werry safe you are,
if I do say it as shouldn't.  It's a werry crooked
story, sir&mdash;dang it, Mr. 'Ammer, don't interrupt!"
</p>

<p>
For a wonder the last words were so irritably
shot out that Hammer sank back, listening, his
questions stilled.  So he heard what had chanced,
with a slowly-gathering horror in his heart, and
a great grief filling his soul, for the words of John
Solomon bit into him ineffaceably.
</p>

<p>
When the launch had drifted in toward the
shore, Harcourt had just been bringing up the
<i>Daphne</i> to Melindi, and had picked up the launch
with her searchlight.  Harcourt himself had
contracted a slight touch of fever, but had insisted
on bringing the senseless Hammer and Miss Helmuth
aboard personally, and the off-shore breeze had
not aided his fever to any extent.
</p>

<p>
Alarmed at the story told by the girl, and the
condition of Hammer, who had remained unconscious
that night, Harcourt had gone ashore early
the next morning intent on getting a doctor.
</p>

<p>
He had barely left his boat when a figure had
started out from the crowd of natives about him
with a shriek, and the next thing anyone knew
was that Harcourt was lying in a pool of blood,
stabbed in the side.
</p>

<p>
Solomon had appeared on the spot, and being
known, it seemed, to the native constabulary,
had assumed charge of Harcourt.  Getting the
story of Hammer and Miss Helmuth from the
four German sailors who had rowed the captain
ashore, he had sent for them as well, installing
all three at his cotton plantation a mile outside
the town.
</p>

<p>
Here an English physician had come to attend
them from the <i>Juba</i>, then in port, and had remained
until a few moments before.  Hammer had been
given a sleeping-draught the day previous, his
own slight fever had vanished altogether, and he
was perfectly well: but Harcourt was dying.
</p>

<p>
From his delirium Solomon and the girl had
gathered that his attacker had been
Jenson&mdash;probably rendered insane by fear at sight of
Harcourt.  At this juncture the American
disregarded Solomon and broke in with a single
curt question, his face grim.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Jenson?"
</p>

<p>
"No one knows, Mr. Hammer," answered the
girl gently, placing her hand on his wrist for a
moment.  "Wait, please!  It was not found out
who had stabbed Captain Harcourt until we found
it out from his ravings.  Then Mr. Solomon said
not to tell the authorities anything about it."
</p>

<p>
Hammer looked at the supercargo, a flame of
grief and fury in his hard, grey eyes, his face
tense.
</p>

<p>
"Explain this, Solomon, or by Godfrey&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. 'Ammer," and for a brief instant the
American was all but awed by the look in the
wide blue eyes, "I liked you, and I liked
Mr. Harcourt, more than I like most men.  If so be
as you're bound to do it, then report the thing;
but I says, wait.  Just like that, Mr. 'Ammer&mdash;wait.
I 'as me own ways of doing a thing up
ship-shape, and I'm older than you be,
Mr. 'Ammer, havin' learned a mortal lot in me day.
I knows the authorities, Mr. 'Ammer, and I
knows John Solomon, and I gives you me Bible
oath that this 'ere Jenson answers to us for what
'e's been and done."
</p>

<p>
The eyes of the two men gripped and held for
a long moment.  Hammer, struck to the heart
by the news of Harcourt as he was, a furious
madness for revenge tearing at his brain, yet
felt a curious impulse to obey this John Solomon.
</p>

<p>
All the obsequiousness of the latter had vanished,
and in its place had come a quiet assurance, a
steadiness, that could not but impress the American.
More than this, even, did the next words of Sara
Helmuth restrain him.
</p>

<p>
"Please, Mr. Hammer, don't be hasty in this
affair.  Believe me, I know a good deal more
than I did that night in the launch, and when you
know it, too, I think that you will agree fully
with me.  Beside, Mr. Harcourt is&mdash;is&mdash;the doctor
said that he would not live more than a few hours
longer."
</p>

<p>
Not until that moment did Hammer fully
realize how dear his friend had become to him.  It
was to him an incredibly dreadful thing that after
all he had passed through, after finding Harcourt,
after coming to like and to be liked&mdash;that the gods
had now snatched this gift from him, just when he
was coming to most depend on the other man.
</p>

<p>
"My God!" he said under his breath, and dropped
his head into his hands.  "Harcourt dying!"
</p>

<p>
It was horrible; a thing almost beyond his
comprehension.  But, so deep down in his soul
that even he did not realize it, was fear&mdash;fear
that he would go back to what Harcourt had dragged
him from&mdash;fear that the old terrible bitterness
would sweep back over him and smother him.
Suddenly he looked up, his face drawn and grey.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;last night you were singing!" he cried
hoarsely, and his eyes shot accusation into the
brown pitying gaze of Sara Helmuth.  "What do
you mean?  Are you playing with me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Be quiet!"  Solomon's voice rang harsh and
stern.  "'Ow dare you, Mr. 'Ammer!  I says this
'ere lady is an angel&mdash;why, dang it, sir, she 'asn't
slept for two blessed nights, what o' watching
wi' you and 'im!  Yes, she was a singing,
Mr. 'Ammer, 'cause Mr. Harcourt 'e thought she was
'is mother, 'e did, and wouldn't go&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, stop it, stop it!" Hammer groaned,
waving his hand in desperation.  "I'm sorry, Miss
Helmuth&mdash;I understand now.  Take me to Harcourt,
please."
</p>

<p>
He gained his feet, careless of the fact that he
was dressed only in a suit of pyjamas.  Sara
Helmuth looked after him, her eyes brimming, but
did not move; Solomon led him out into a wide
hallway and across into another room.
</p>

<p>
Harcourt was lying in a cot, wasted, pale to
ghastliness, dark circles under his eyes, but none
the less with his mouth wearing its same
good-humoured lines.  By his side was a chair, and into
this Hammer dropped, gazing down at the sleeping
face of the man who had been his friend.
</p>

<p>
How long he sat there he did not know.  He
was vaguely aware that Solomon had gone away on
tiptoe, but before his mind's eye were passing
scenes, pictures of Harcourt as he had known him
from day to day, now sharp and clear-cut, now dim
and ill-remembered.
</p>

<p>
And three days had wrought this change!  Three
days, death in their wake, had transformed the
broad-shouldered, clean-minded Englishman into
this wasted semblance of himself.
</p>

<p>
"Good God," muttered Hammer, licking his
dry lips.  "It's horrible!"
</p>

<p>
As he breathed the words to himself, leaning
over the bed, the dark eyelids flickered and opened,
and Harcourt's blue eyes met his&mdash;at first with
blank unrecognition, then with surprised delight.
Harcourt smiled faintly, and his voice came clear
but weak.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, old chap!  You're&mdash;by Jove, where's
that Jenson?"
</p>

<p>
The blue eyes had suddenly flashed out with
anger as Harcourt remembered.  The American,
with more tenderness than he had ever thought to
show any man, put out a hand to the cold brow of
his friend.
</p>

<p>
"Quiet, old man; we'll take care of all that."
</p>

<p>
For the life of him he could not repress the
message that leaped from his own eyes to those of
the other.  Harcourt looked up steadily; he had
read the message aright, but the clear blue eyes
never faltered.
</p>

<p>
"So bad as all that, old chap?"
</p>

<p>
Hammer nodded, his mouth quivering as he bit
at his lips; then the words burst forth brokenly.
</p>

<p>
"God knows I wish&mdash;he'd taken&mdash;me instead,
Harcourt!"
</p>

<p>
The other put out a weak hand to his, still
smiling.
</p>

<p>
"I say, old chap, don't be so bally broken up!
How long?"
</p>

<p>
Before Hammer replied a step sounded, and he
looked up to see Solomon.
</p>

<p>
"What-o!" exclaimed that individual cheerily.
"Inwalid woke up?  We'll&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Solomon's voice died away, and into his wide
blue eyes crept a look of utmost sympathy and
kindness as he saw that Harcourt knew.
</p>

<p>
"How long can I count on, Solomon?"
</p>

<p>
"It's 'ard to say, sir.  An hour, the doctor
said&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"All right.  I want to make a will, don't you
know.  I say, Hammer, brace up!  'Pon my word,
I'm having a splendid time, old chap; I've
always wanted to have a look in on the stage and
see how things were run."
</p>

<p>
"I'm a notary public, sir, if so be as you wants
to&mdash;&mdash;" suggested Solomon.
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  Hammer, you don't mind leaving
us alone for a bit?"
</p>

<p>
The American, choking, rose and left the room,
returning to his own.  Miss Helmuth had vanished,
and he stood over his cot, looking out the window,
and fighting back his emotion with grim intensity.
It seemed untold ages before his door opened and
he turned to face the master of the house.
</p>

<p>
"'E's all through, Mr. 'Ammer, and wants you.
Werry weak 'e is, sir."
</p>

<p>
Hammer strode back hurriedly and dropped
beside Harcourt.
</p>

<p>
"Hammer, old chap," and Harcourt's voice
was faint.  "I'm not afraid to meet the Stage
Manager; but, Christian or not, I do wish that
you'd get Jenson for me, will you?  Not that I
object particularly, don't you know, but I do
object to being hurried in such a bally indecent
way."
</p>

<p>
"I'll get him," muttered Harcourt, meeting the
clear blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I'll get him, Harcourt, and I'll get his master
with him, by Godfrey!"
</p>

<p>
"Werry good, sir!" echoed the voice of Solomon
behind.
</p>

<p>
Harcourt's gaze shifted and the trace of a smile
crept into his colourless cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, Solomon, do you know who killed that
bally second mate?"
</p>

<p>
"I did, sir."
</p>

<p>
Hammer heard the words dully, but they did
not pierce to his brain, nor would he have heeded
them if they had done so.  Harcourt's vitality was
ebbing fast, and their hands came together for the
last time.
</p>

<p>
"Well, old chap," and his voice was little more
than a whisper, "no bally preaching, you
know&mdash;but take care of yourself.  And I wish you'd take me
cut to sea for the last scene, if you don't mind.
Beastly country to rot in, this.  What's the time,
John?"
</p>

<p>
"Four bells, sir, afternoon watch."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks very much."
</p>

<p>
Silence ensured, while Hammer's grey eyes
fastened hungrily on the face of his friend, and
Harcourt gazed up, still smiling faintly.
</p>

<p>
Then the blue eyes closed, but the hand that the
American held still pressed his feebly.  After
a moment Harcourt looked up again, a tinge of
colour in his cheeks, and spoke in his old voice.
</p>

<p>
"Don't forget&mdash;Jenson.  Good luck, old chap!"
</p>

<p>
And there were but two men in the room.

CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />
JOHN SOLOMON PREPARES FOR ACTION
</h3>

<p>
"Solomon, I wish you'd tell me about that Schlak
business, just to get it off my mind."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; just a moment.  Miss 'Elmuth, can
you bring to mind the date o' that 'ere scrimmage
up at the camp?"
</p>

<p>
Hammer stared, for the supercargo&mdash;supercargo
no longer&mdash;seemed to think more about getting his
notes down in that little red morocco notebook than
he did about the death of Schlak.  Presently,
however, Solomon closed and carefully placed a rubber
band about the notebook, shoving it into his pocket.
</p>

<p>
"I likes to keep my accounts all ship-shape, sir
and missus, and I must say as 'ow I'm getting a
mortal big account over against the name o' Krausz.
Why, Mr. 'Ammer, 'ere's the facts o' the case.
</p>

<p>
"You may remember as 'ow, that night, I was
gone from mess for a bit?  Well, I'd slipped up to
Mr. Schlak's cabin to see if I could find something
I was after&mdash;papers connected wi' the expedition,
they was.
</p>

<p>
"I 'ad the paper I'd taken from the doctor's
pocket, and was comparing of it with some others
I found when, lo and behold, in pops Mr. Schlak!
</p>

<p>
"'E never says a word, 'e don't, but just goes for
me.  Lud, but it did give me a turn for a moment,
sir!  Forchnit it was me 'and fell on 'is knife,
where it 'ung on the wall, after 'e'd knocked me
back and took me by the throat.  No, I 'ad to do
it, miss; it was 'is life or mine, and no mistake."
</p>

<p>
It was four days after the sea funeral of Harcourt.
The latter, by the terms of his hasty but authentic
will, had left to Hammer all his property, consisting
of the <i>Daphne</i>.
</p>

<p>
At first the American had flatly refused to
accept the yacht, until the practical, hard-headed
common sense of John Solomon won him around;
and when he put the case up to Sara Helmuth she
had promptly decided that he should accept.
</p>

<p>
He did so, was duly constituted as lawful owner,
and there being no objections to the first mate's
papers, obtained for him by Solomon, took command
of the yacht until her arrival in England once
again.  She was at anchor off the river, Hammer and
Sara Helmuth remaining with Solomon until
they had agreed upon some plan.
</p>

<p>
Hammer began to feel that it was time for action.
No word had drifted in from the ruins of Fort
St. Thomas during the week that had intervened,
and Hammer's grief had settled into a determined
thirst for vengeance.
</p>

<p>
Solomon was at one with him in this, but had
exercised a restraining influence to which Hammer
had yielded with good grace.  He had begun to find
out things about John Solomon.
</p>

<p>
The man seemed to have no lack of money, and
it was apparent that he was neither supercargo
nor cotton-planter.  The very character of his
visitors precluded that, while it but vexed
Hammer the more.
</p>

<p>
On one occasion it was a Kiswahili chieftain
from up-coast; on another a party of dirty but
stately Arabs from a dhow in port; on another a
bearded, khaki-clad officer of police from
somewhere up-country.  These visitors were received
in private and departed as they came, without
meeting Hammer or Miss Helmuth.
</p>

<p>
On this, the fourth day after the sea-burial,
all three were sitting in a large living-room on
the ground floor of the house.  Like the other
rooms it held many rugs, together with native
weapons and two of the ancient Shishkhana rifles
from Damascus, of which Solomon was inordinately
proud.
</p>

<p>
He had been seated over a little desk in the
corner, busily writing in his red notebook, and
when at last the impatient American had got
the story of Schlak's death out of him he squatted
down on some cushions beside Sara Helmuth,
who, with her quiet common sense which
embarrassed Hammer at times, was darning socks for
the two men.
</p>

<p>
"About Jenson now," he continued, whittling
at his tobacco plug&mdash;"it don't pay to be in a
'urry, Mr. 'Ammer.  I 'ave men out 'unting for
Potbelly&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But, confound it, Solomon, why can't I go
up there and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Now, Mr. 'Ammer, don't take on so!  First
off, we 'as t' get this 'ere business straightened
out all ship-shape and proper, so to speak; and
the East ain't the West, Mr. 'Ammer.
</p>

<p>
"If so be as you wanted a certain book, you'd
say, 'Get the book I gave you last night,' which
is all werry well in its place, I says; but if you
was talking Hindi you'd say, 'What book was
by me given to you yesterday at night, that book
fetchin' to me, come.'
</p>

<p>
"Now, Mr. 'Ammer, that's just a sample, like.
The East ain't the West, I says, and a werry good
job that it ain't.  Besides, there's the missus to
think on, sir."
</p>

<p>
Hammer glanced at Sara Helmuth, who smiled
at him, noticing that his face was older than it
had been a week before&mdash;that it was graver, finer
drawn.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it's time for an understanding,
Mr. Hammer.  I haven't seen much of you the last
two or three days, you know, but Mr. Solomon
and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Make it John, miss, if you don't mind,"
broke in Solomon pleadingly.  "It's John with
me friends, if I may make so bold as to place
you in that 'ere category."
</p>

<p>
"All right, then," laughed the girl.  "John and
I have had an understanding, Mr. Hammer&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Make it Cyrus, miss," interrupted the American,
his eyes narrowing in a slight smile as he met her
gaze.  "Or cut off the mister and make it plain
Hammer, both of you."
</p>

<p>
"Hammer it is!" exclaimed the girl, though
John shook his head solemnly.  "So, of course,
I'll reciprocate with plain Sara.  And now let
me finish.  The whole story that Dr. Krausz told
you, Hammer, was untrue."
</p>

<p>
"What?  You don't mean about the treasure
stuff&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, for he changed that to suit himself.  Now,
here's the real story.  My father found a number
of old papers in Lisbon giving the whole thing,
and wrote it to Solomon, intending to join him
later and go shares on it.  In 1696 Fort Jesus,
or Mombasa, was besieged by the Arabs.
</p>

<p>
"That siege lasted for thirty-three months, for
the Portuguese sent over help from Goa, but in
the meantime all the other Portuguese settlements
were being destroyed.
</p>

<p>
"Our own Fort St. Thomas was able to hold out
until Fort Jesus had fallen, when the Arab fleet
came up and put everyone in the fort to the sword.
We don't know who escaped, but, at anyrate,
father found the papers telling about the treasure.
It seems that the Viceroy of Goa had sent some
alleged relics of St. Thomas, who was supposed
to have died in India, you know, back to the King
of Portugal; and with them he had sent a lot of
valuable papers and documents, as well as such
things as gold and jewels&mdash;there has to be a
treasure, of course.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that ship put into the bay which used
to be at St. Thomas; she was driven ashore, and
the garrison only had time to transfer her cargo
to the fort before they were attacked.  So far
as anyone knows to the contrary, Hammer, it's
there yet."
</p>

<p>
"I guess not."  The American shook his head.
"Krausz has it by now; you can lay on that&mdash;Sara."
</p>

<p>
His brief hesitation before her name was answered
by a slight flush as she laughed quickly up at
him.
</p>

<p>
"No, he hasn't!  At least, not the papers, the
best part of all.  They were hidden away separately,
and not even father knew it, There was one paper
he could not translate, for it was written in cipher,
so he sent it direct to John.  That paper told
about the hiding-place of the papers and the
relics, and Krausz never heard of it."
</p>

<p>
Hammer glanced at Solomon, beginning to
grow interested in this treasure-hunt in spite
of himself.
</p>

<p>
"What kind of a chap are you, John?  By
Godfrey, I'm thinking that you must be some kind
of wizard!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. 'Ammer, so the Arabs do say.  You
see, sir, I've 'ad a bit o' luck wi' the rosary
predictions&mdash;'El Rame!', the Arabs call it&mdash;and
I'm free to admit, sir and miss, that it ain't far
removed from rank sorcery to a Christian's way
o' thinking.  But I've learned a mortal lot in
me time, Mr. 'Ammer, and 'ave 'andled some
main ticklish jobs.
</p>

<p>
"You might not think it, sir, but I've a fondness
for these 'ere rugs, and I've got some as
couldn't be bought, sir&mdash;sent to me by different
'ands.  But put not your trust in Hajjis and
Sayyids as the Good Book says: no, sir, I 'olds
to me own game and plays it me own way.  Just
so with this 'ere Jenson; and when Potbelly gets
back, why, we go after 'im and 'is master and
the loot, all in one pile."
</p>

<p>
"Potbelly?" queried Hammer.  "Is he a man of
yours?"
</p>

<p>
"One of a few, sir, and not so black as 'e's
painted.  A Hazrami, 'e is; them Hazramaut
men wanders all over, sir&mdash;reg'lar soldiers o'
fortune, like.  The Hindus say: 'If you meet a
viper and a Hazrami, spare the viper'.  But this
'ere man Potbelly, which ain't 'is proper name,
is main useful.  Lud, what I've seen that man
do!  A actor, 'e is, sir."
</p>

<p>
Hammer learned that nothing had been heard
of Potbelly, but men were looking for him.  He
also learned that Solomon had, in reality, been
the <i>deus ex machina</i> during the entire cruise of
the yacht, and that he had managed the affair
at Port Said, thus detaining three of the Germans
and replacing them with his own men in case
of trouble.  As he had advised dismissing the
remaining Germans at once, they had been
summarily discharged and sent to Mombasa.
</p>

<p>
Thither, Hammer decided to follow them.
Roberts, the steward, had already been sent home
with his master's personal effects, and the sooner
the yacht was in the shelter of Kilindini harbour
the better.
</p>

<p>
As Solomon wished to get two Afghan friends
of his up from Mombasa, Hammer concluded
to take down the yacht in the morning; for it
was beginning of November, and the south-west
monsoon was threatening the insecure anchorage
of Melindi.
</p>

<p>
"What day is this?" he asked suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"The 14th day o' the month Zil Ka'adah,"
rejoined Solomon, with a twinkle in his eye.
"Year o' the Hegira, 1331.  In other words, sir,
it's Thursday."
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll be back on the <i>Juba</i> Sunday night,"
reflected Hammer.  "What are your plans?"
</p>

<p>
Solomon's plans were quite well-defined, once
he stated them.  He intended to go up-coast to
old Fort St. Thomas by launch, sending a party
of Arabs around by land; the natives would be
easily sent away, leaving Krausz with six Germans
and Jenson.
</p>

<p>
The last-named would be either given up or
taken by force, and Krausz could get back to
Melindi and Mombasa as best he might, while
with their men Solomon and Hammer dug up
the ruins.
</p>

<p>
Sara Helmuth insisted that she be of the party
also, and since there was no great danger to be
apprehended, Solomon consented.
</p>

<p>
He bade Hammer keep the little silver ring,
saying that most of the natives knew the emblem
and that it might prove of help to him at some
future time.
</p>

<p>
Frankly mystified, Hammer questioned the man
directly as to who and what he was; but Solomon
merely laughed and waved a hand complacently.
</p>

<p>
"Easy, sir&mdash;easy!  A man as asks too much
gets less'n 'e asks, I says; it ain't in 'uman nature
to be answerin' of questions, I says, but Lud,
there's few men as understands 'uman nature,
Mr. 'Ammer!  Ship's stores, me line is,
Mr. 'Ammer, and I 'as me little shop in Port Said
all neat and ship-shape like, where I'll be mortal
glad to receive ye on 'appier occasions, sir
and miss."
</p>

<p>
Hammer gave up questioning his ex-supercargo.
Sara Helmuth proved to know no more than did he
himself, but he had talked much with her of other
things, striving to gain something of her poise
and perfect self-confidence.  For the American
was in deadly fear of himself.
</p>

<p>
With each day the old bitterness had been
surging back into his heart, driving him to action
no matter what it might be.  Harcourt's death
had been a sore stroke to him, and yet&mdash;even
more than he could comprehend&mdash;the presence
and friendship of Sara Helmuth had upborne him
and kept him from the brooding which had proven
his undoing in time past.
</p>

<p>
He listened without interest as Solomon questioned
the girl about the old fort and her preliminary
work in getting it cleared of brush and
trees.  As she replied to his queries, Hammer saw
a frown slowly gathering on Solomon's pudgy
face; then the little man pulled out his clay pipe
and tobacco and began to whittle thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"All werry good, miss," he declared finally,
"but I'm mortal sorry as 'ow you 'ad all that
work for nothing."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" she asked quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I thought as 'ow I'd say nothing about
it till the proper time, miss; but this 'ere's the
proper time, I says.  You see, that there place you
was a-workin' on wasn't the fort at all, miss; it
was just the ruins of the old store-house and slave
barracoon, at what used to be the water's edge.
The fort itself is a matter o' two hundred yards
back in the jungle, miss."
</p>

<p>
While Hammer and the girl stared at him,
almost in incredulity, he went on to explain,
with one of his quiet chuckles.  He had visited
the ruins four years previously on an inspection
with the district commissioner from Melindi, and
so was aware of there being two sets of ruins.
</p>

<p>
Those of the fort proper were well overgrown
by the jungle, but were in much better preservation
than those on the hill, which had been
levelled long since by the elements.
</p>

<p>
Bearing this in mind, he had instructed Potbelly
to meet the party of Miss Helmuth and to lead
her to the lesser ruins, saying nothing about those
of the fort proper.
</p>

<p>
This Potbelly had done, and in consequence
Dr. Krausz was spending time and money in digging
up ancient slave barracoons, knowing nothing of
the real fort so close to him.
</p>

<p>
Hammer could not understand this until Solomon
explained the density of the jungle near the place,
which was uncrossed by any native tracks.
</p>

<p>
"But if he got the location from the papers
left by your father," argued the American, "surely
he would know better, Sara.  He's a man of
experience&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not in Africa," broke in Solomon, chuckling.
"Not in Africa 'e ain't!  Them places was all
alike, sir&mdash;just a square with a roof over it, like.
The fort's just three o' them there squares with
a wall around and other buildin's in between.
No, sir; in them papers you mentions, 'e found
where to dig, prowiding 'e got the right place.
So 'e's a-digging of his bloomin' 'ead off, and much
good may it do 'im, I says.  When so be as we
gets ready to dig, why, them Arabs o' mine will
'ave it all ready cleared for us.  It's so mortal
thick in there, sir, that two parties could live
for a year on end, ten yards apart, and never know
it&mdash;just like that, sir."
</p>

<p>
In the end Hammer was forced to admit the
logic of Solomon's reasoning, though when he
learned that the Arabs were probably on the spot
by this time he refused to believe that they would
not be discovered at work.
</p>

<p>
The Afghans he was to pick up at Mombasa
had been despatched to Goa by Solomon in the
endeavour to learn something definite about the
old fort; but whether they had done so or not
Solomon did not know.
</p>

<p>
Nor could the American understand the other's
choice of men.  Why he should send Afghans on
such an errand, why he should trust Potbelly and
make use of him as he did, why he should seemingly
put so much trust in natives and so little trust
in white men, drew a series of questions from
Hammer which forced Solomon to explain.
</p>

<p>
"White men is all werry well in their place,
sir, but Africa ain't their place.  Me men know
me, Mr. 'Ammer, and 'as faith in me.  White
men can't 'elp from talking too much, sir; but
it ain't in the nature of brown men to talk.
</p>

<p>
"Work a brown man all square and aboveboard,
I says, and 'e'll curse ye for a bloody fool;
but work 'im underhand, like what e's been used
to for the last thousand years, and 'e'll fair go
through fire and water for ye.  What 'e loves is
the game, sir&mdash;same as me.  It ain't the money
as I'm after, though I do say as money 'as its
uses."
</p>

<p>
Which was all Hammer ever extracted from
John Solomon on the matter of colour.
</p>

<p>
That night, after a long talk with Sara Helmuth,
the American went out to the <i>Daphne</i>.  He had
not been able to nerve himself to the deed before
this, but now installed himself in Harcourt's
cabin and arranged with the chief engineer to
sign on a crew at Mombasa as fast as the men
could be picked up.
</p>

<p>
He was without money, practically, and doubted
very much whether he would be able to make
the yacht pay in future&mdash;for this, however, he
made no plans; his first duty was to get hold of
Jenson, and what came after that did not trouble
him greatly.
</p>

<p>
At Mombasa he found the two Afghans without
trouble.  Both were heavily-bearded, stalwart men,
of keen intelligence, and cousins; Akhbar Khan
and Yar Hussein were alike, grave-eyed, dignified,
green-turbaned, and dependable.  Hammer
concluded that John Solomon knew what he was
about, after all.
</p>

<p>
His only business ashore was to get the two
Afghans, and with them he returned to the waiting
launch, provisioned and manned by Solomon's
four Arabs, for the run up-coast.
</p>

<p>
He did not go near the club, and saw no one
he knew until reaching the wharf.  Here, however,
he ran into a little Cockney, a waiter at the club
the evening he had so gloriously awakened Mombasa.
</p>

<p>
Finding the man staring at him, he nodded
and would have passed on, but the fellow plucked
his sleeve.
</p>

<p>
"Beg pardon, guv'nor, but you'd best cut and
run for it.  I heard two o' them nigger bobbies
sayin' as 'ow they was lookin' for you up-town."
</p>

<p>
"Eh?  I guess you've made a mistake, my
man!" exclaimed the American.  The other winked
and sidled away hastily.
</p>

<p>
"Just a tip, guv'nor.  Don't wyste no time&mdash;&mdash;"
and he was gone.
</p>

<p>
Laughing over the occurrence, and thinking
that the man was drunk, Hammer dropped into
the launch and the wharf was soon left behind.
</p>

<p>
He had decided not to go up on the <i>Juba</i>, as
the launch would be of use to them and he could
make a quicker run up in her.  Solomon had a
launch hired at Melindi, but another would not
come amiss, he thought.  Nor did it, as events
proved.
</p>

<p>
The run to Melindi was uneventful in the extreme,
and they made the river-mouth shortly after nine
in the evening.  Bidding the Arabs and Afghans
come to the plantation with him, where there
were a number of buildings in which they could
find shelter.  Hammer led the way at once.
</p>

<p>
To his surprise, the plantation-house was dark
save for the servants' quarters, nor was there
anyone to greet him.
</p>

<p>
Mystified and no little startled by the empty
rooms, the American lit some of the lamps and
soon had the house-boys on the jump.
</p>

<p>
The only information that he could elicit from
them was that Potbelly had come that morning,
and Solomon and Sara Helmuth had gone shortly
after luncheon&mdash;where, no one knew or would say.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br /><br />
UNDER SUSPICION
</h3>

<p>
Irritated almost beyond control by Solomon's
exasperating method of playing his hand in the
dark, Hammer passed a very bad night.
</p>

<p>
More than once he was on the point of sending
a boy to Melindi for the district commissioner and
of putting the whole case into the hands of the
authorities, and only his promise to Harcourt
restrained him, for he had come to look upon that
promise as a personal pledge, to be carried out by
himself alone.
</p>

<p>
Why had Solomon gone off without leaving him
any word, and why had he taken Sara Helmuth
with him?  Perhaps the latter query worried the
American more than the former.
</p>

<p>
He overlooked the facts that Sara Helmuth was
quite competent so far as taking care of herself
was concerned; that she had as much or more
interest in the entire affair than he had, and that
she was not the kind of person to sit idly by while
Solomon worked in her behalf.
</p>

<p>
Evidently Potbelly's tidings had in some way
drawn them off the original plan, though Hammer
could not see how.
</p>

<p>
The Hazrami, who was masquerading as a
Kiswahili, must have brought back important
news to bestir Solomon to such rapid action, for
at dawn no move had been contemplated till
Hammer's return.  Besides, Solomon had no taste
for hurry, as the American knew.
</p>

<p>
The two Afghans and the four Arabs had received
the news of Solomon's absence with grave
acquiescence, departing to the rooms assigned them by
the house servants, who were all Kiswahili.
Akhbar Khan had carried a small roll of sheepskin,
the only baggage of the two, and this he had
taken with him.
</p>

<p>
But when Hammer descended to breakfast both
Akhbar Khan and Yar Hussein had vanished
bodily, sheepskin and all.  The four Arabs could
tell nothing of them, and, although Hammer
expended all his store of Arabic upon the house
servants, he elicited nothing but the surprising
information that the two visitors must have been
djinns, since they had flown away in the night,
even as they had come.
</p>

<p>
So the American cursed them all impartially
in the name of Allah and bade them leave him
alone, which they did willingly.  There being
nothing better to do, he gave himself up to waiting;
but an hour later he was pleasurably surprised
by the arrival of no less a person than Potbelly
himself.
</p>

<p>
Now, however, he came in his own guise.  No
longer a Kiswahili, he had doffed his pseudo-mission
clothes and came in all the stately pride
of a Hazrami, an Arab of the Arabs, masterless,
and bowing to no man.
</p>

<p>
Yet, in spite of his white burnoose and green
turban of the pilgrimage, he was weary and in much
need of repair, having plainly come through the
bush.  He insisted on speaking French, also, to
the further annoyance of Hammer, though the
American could understand him well enough.
</p>

<p>
"It's about time you came, Potbelly," grunted
Hammer ungraciously.  "What's your news?
Where's Solomon?"
</p>

<p>
For answer the Arab settled himself on a rug,
clapped his hands, and demanded coffee from the
boy who came, and then saw to it that his proper
self made a proper impression on Hammer.
</p>

<p>
"I am no longer Potbelly, <i>m'sieu'</i>, but the
Hajj Omar ibn Kasim el Hamumi&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I don't care a whoop who you are!" exclaimed
Hammer angrily.  "Give me your message or get
out of here!"
</p>

<p>
A wounded look from Omar ibn Kasim was
followed promptly by his news, as he met the eye
of Hammer, and saw fury smouldering there.
</p>

<p>
But, mindful of the words of John Solomon,
the American forced himself to restraint and let
Omar tell the tale in his own fashion, which
consisted largely in dwelling on every little circumstance
to the full, and lauding his own efforts with
great self-satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
The gist of the tale, as Hammer finally extracted
it, was that Omar had held Dr. Krausz and his
men helpless until Hammer and Sara Helmuth
had obtained a good start on any possible pursuit.
</p>

<p>
Then, knowing that he had no retreat by sea,
he had shouted to Miss Helmuth's mission-boys
to join him in the jungle, and had plunged into
the midst of it, chancing upon the real ruins of
the fort.
</p>

<p>
At this point his story was full of fanciful
interpolations, as Hammer termed them, concerning
monkeys who threw skulls at him, and pits
full of snakes.  After weird and wholly impossible
adventures he had met Solomon's party of Arabs,
who were later joined by Sara Helmuth's mission-boys.
</p>

<p>
Since the Arabs, whom he wrathfully described
as "men without shame", were determined to
carry out Solomon's orders, and laughed at his
stories of the ruins, he had come on to Melindi
with the mission-boys.
</p>

<p>
Midway, however, he had come down with fever,
which explained his delay.  The mission-boys had
cared for him, and Hammer shrewdly judged
that he had made the most of his illness, for at
present he displayed no great signs of emaciation.
</p>

<p>
On the day before, as he was coming into town,
he had seen a party of nine men leaving; of these
stalwart Masai <i>askaris</i>, bearing the eagle of the
German Consulate on the collars of their tunics.
Here the American interrupted wrathfully:
</p>

<p>
"What manner of lie is this, Omar ibn Kasim?
How should these men get here from Mombasa?"
</p>

<p>
"Did not the <i>Juba</i> arrive the day before
yesterday, and does it not arrive again to-morrow,
Yaum el Ahad?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, to-morrow is Sunday," retorted the
American, "but that doesn't explain how Jenson
could have fetched those <i>askaris</i> from Mombasa."
</p>

<p>
"A week has passed, <i>effendi</i>," and the other
struck into Arabic.  "Am I a liar, then?  <i>Al Nar
wa la al Ar</i>!  May fire seize on me, but not shame!
If I lie, <i>effendi</i>, may I be childless, may my&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, cut it out and go on!" groaned Hammer
wearily, recognizing his want of tact in dealing
with the man.  "You are more truthful than the
Koran, Omar Ibn Kasim, so finish the story and I
will doubt no more."
</p>

<p>
Mollified, the Arab told how he had brought the
news to Solomon, and how that individual had
at once set out after Jenson, taking him for guide.
</p>

<p>
Miss Helmuth had gone with them, with enough
boys from the plantation to make a respectable
safari.  As they had failed to come up with Jenson
by nightfall, in the morning Solomon had
despatched the Arab to bring up Hammer.
</p>

<p>
"Then it's time we started," growled the latter,
angry at Solomon, Omar, himself, and everyone
else.  "If we had only got the authorities after the
fellow," he thought, "it would have been all over
by this time.  Confound Solomon!  It's too late now."
</p>

<p>
He questioned Omar about the two Afghans,
but the latter knew nothing of them.  Neither did
he have any inclination to hurry forth into the
jungle again, and said so plainly as he sipped his
coffee.
</p>

<p>
Hammer, exasperated by the coolness and almost
contempt of the man, could restrain himself no
longer.  Starting from his seat, he grasped the
arm of Omar with a wrench that sent the man to
his back on the rug.
</p>

<p>
"Now," and he glared at the angry Arab with
his grey eyes hard and cold, "I've had enough of
your insolence, my friend, and I don't give a
hang whether you're a Hajj or a Hazrami or
Mohammed himself.  You're going to lead me to
John Solomon, and do it on the jump&mdash;understand?"
</p>

<p>
This was exactly the action required.  Omar
looked up at him for a moment, then his dark face
cleared, and he stated that he understood and would
do exactly as the <i>effendi</i> ordered, though he was
dying for lack of food.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," and Hammer released him.
"Do all the dying you want to but not until you
have led me to Solomon <i>Effendi</i>.  Now, get out and
see that you have some boys ready to start within
an hour, else I go alone and spread the story of your
shame through all the coast.  Jump!"
</p>

<p>
Omar jumped, and, with the four Arab soldiers
to help him, he speedily raised a force of twenty
boys from the plantation quarters.
</p>

<p>
As Hammer knew where Solomon's stores of
chop-boxes and supplies were located, he broke
into the storehouse without scruple and left
Omar getting the loads ready.
</p>

<p>
Though he searched every room in the main house,
he could find no arms save the weapons adorning
the walls, and these were handsome but useless
to him.
</p>

<p>
Evidently Solomon had small use for weapons,
so he was forced to bide content with his own two
revolvers.  Meanwhile, the problem of Jenson
and the consulate <i>askaris</i> was worrying him.
</p>

<p>
There was no doubt that the secretary had swum
ashore, either frightened or wounded by Sara
Helmuth's bullet, the night he had stabbed
Mohammed Bari in the launch.  He had met Harcourt
the next morning, probably after hiding on the
wharf all night; and where had he been during the
intervening week?
</p>

<p>
Remembering the <i>askaris</i>, Hammer whistled
softly and consulted Omar ibn Kasim, who replied
to his questions with the information that the
German Consul in Mombasa did not have <i>askaris</i>,
requiring no protection; but that all the Consulates
in Zanzibar did, and, further, that if a man was
fool enough to be in a hurry he could get to
Zanzibar from Mombasa and back in a couple of days,
more or less.
</p>

<p>
This, then, explained the actions of Jenson
fairly well.  Immediately after his stabbing
Harcourt he must have gone aboard the <i>Juba</i> to
Mombasa&mdash;but would he have the influence and authority
to command <i>askaris</i>?  Also, he was taking them to
Fort St. Thomas, a thing he would never dare
do on his own initiative.  This compelled a
readjustment.
</p>

<p>
Evidently, then, Jenson had gone to Dr. Krausz,
either overland or by launch.  This could be verified
by ascertaining in Melindi if he had hired a launch
at the time in question; yet he must have done so
to account for his other movements.
</p>

<p>
Armed with letters from Krausz, the American
reflected, he had caught the <i>Juba</i> on her next trip,
connected at Mombasa for Zanzibar, and hurried
back with the <i>askaris</i>.  Krausz evidently wanted
men who could shoot, as these Masai could.
</p>

<p>
Hammer strongly doubted whether it was legal
or not to bring the Consulate guards from Zanzibar
up here into British East Africa.  Certainly, the
German Consul would take no such risk, for the
thing would be sure to demand investigation if
illegal, as Hammer thought it was.
</p>

<p>
How, then, had Jenson secured the men?  Probably
by misrepresentations, or else by actual lies;
and if this was the case Hammer felt that he had
Krausz cornered at last.
</p>

<p>
Omar had met the party leaving Melindi, however,
and if Jenson acted thus openly the presence
of the <i>askaris</i> must be unquestioned.
</p>

<p>
The best thing to do was to see the district
commissioner about it, thought the American, and with
this thought he issued from the house and sought
out Omar.
</p>

<p>
The latter was ready to start, as was his safari,
and from somewhere the Arab had dug up an ancient
Snider rifle and bandolier, which Hammer eyed with
some disfavour.  As he gave the order to march,
however, a Kiswahili boy ran up with word that
Bwana Somebody was coming, whereat all save
Omar seemed to be affected with sudden fright.
</p>

<p>
The American got them into shape with much
expenditure of Arabic, and as he did so became
aware of a little party coming down the track&mdash;for
the plantation of Solomon, being away from those of
the East African Corporation, did not have the
benefit of any road.
</p>

<p>
The party, as he saw at a glance, consisted of a
very trim and spruce officer of police, a sergeant,
and four men, and that they were coming here he
had no doubt.  So, bidding the natives wait, he
advanced to meet them.
</p>

<p>
"Good afternoon," the officer responded curtly
to his greeting.  "Is there a Mr. Hammer
anywhere about?"
</p>

<p>
"I am Mr. Hammer," replied the American,
surprised.  "Sure you want me!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, rather!" snapped out the other, curtly.
"Sergeant, arrest this man."
</p>

<p>
Before the amazed Hammer knew what was
happening there was a policeman on each side of
him, and the officer's eye had lighted on Omar.
</p>

<p>
"Here, you!  Have you a permit to carry that
<i>bunduki</i>?"
</p>

<p>
The officer was somewhat taken aback when Omar,
grinning, held out a folded paper and replied in
English:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sar.  Licensed to carry one gun, sar."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!"  By the time the officer had glanced
over the permit and returned it with a bad grace,
Hammer had recovered his power of speech.
He knew that something was radically wrong, but
that if he resisted it would be more wrong still, so
he restrained his anger and spoke with what seemed
to him remarkable coolness.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to know what this means, lieutenant!
How dare you arrest me, and on what charge?
What&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Whatever you say will be used against you,"
replied the officer.  "You are under arrest for murder,
sir, and I warn you not to resist.  I just got here in
time evidently; you slipped out of Mombasa pretty
neatly, 'pon my word!"
</p>

<p>
"Slipped your grandmother!" retorted Hammer
with some heat.  "I'm not in the habit of
slipping out of anywhere, you impertinent young
puppy!  I want to know&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"See here, Hammer," and the officer, for all
his youth, showed determination, "I'd advise you to
keep your mouth closed unless you want it closed
for you.  If you can't help talking, wait till you
get closeted with the district commissioner.  I'll
warrant you'll get a mouthful from him, my
man, and no mistake, but in the meantime I'll
thank you not to discuss this affair with me.  I've
no bally use for a man of your stamp, and the less
you say the better for you.  All ready, sergeant?"
</p>

<p>
The sergeant was, and so was Hammer.  Furious
but helpless, he clearly perceived that there was no
use resisting, and that argument with this
business-like young officer was worse than futile.
</p>

<p>
He was but obeying orders, after all, and the
only thing to do was to have it out with the district
commissioner.
</p>

<p>
So, angry at the mere senselessness of the arrest,
the American fell in between the two men and
followed the sergeant, his face pale and hard.
</p>

<p>
As he went he saw that Omar ibn Kasim, after
a quick order in Arabic which he did not catch,
was starting after him.  Struck by a sudden thought,
Hammer held up the hand on which glittered
Solomon's ring.
</p>

<p>
Omar stopped, waved a hand, and departed by
another path in all haste, while Hammer proceeded
with more calmness.  He was suddenly aware that
he had great confidence in John Solomon, and,
whatever this situation was into which he had
stumbled, the pudgy little man would find some
loophole.
</p>

<p>
Then he remembered the Cockney whom he had
met on the Mombasa wharf, and realized that the
thing must be serious indeed if the Mombasa police
were after him.  They had notified Melindi by wire
of course; but of what had they notified?  What
was the cause of the whole business?
</p>

<p>
Hammer racked his brains vainly.  He might
have been arrested for the death of Baumgardner,
although no hue and cry had been raised over
finding any such body along the beach.  Besides,
the testimony of Sara Helmuth would have cleared
him of that, and Solomon had accounted to the
authorities for the death of Mohammed Bari in
some manner or other.
</p>

<p>
It must be some trumped-up charge brought
against him by Krausz, he considered.  The scientist
had no knowledge or fear of John Solomon's
activities, and he was probably trying to get
Hammer out of his way, believing him the only
champion of Sara Helmuth.
</p>

<p>
The reason was plain, for with the persistent
American safely disposed of, pending trial, the
doctor and his aides could get hold of the treasure
and get it stowed away where Sara Helmuth
would never find it.
</p>

<p>
At this reasoning, which proved correct enough
in its way, Hammer chuckled and began to feel
relieved.  Krausz would have a hard job finding
any treasure in the place he was looking for it, that
was sure.
</p>

<p>
As for himself, he would be freed just as soon
as he had had a talk with this asinine district
commissioner, or as soon as Solomon came to the rescue.
And with that Jenson would be tracked down in
short order.
</p>

<p>
"By Godfrey, he's going to swing for that
murder!"  Hammer swore savagely to himself,
almost forgetting his own plight.  The party
had swung into the road by this time, passing
old and new cotton plantations on every hand, for
Melindi threatened to become a big
cotton-producing centre in no long while.
</p>

<p>
On whatever evidence Krausz had trumped up
this charge against him, thought the American,
he was reasonably sure of getting off in a day
or two, and it would be more than a day or two ere
Jenson got out of the country.  He was not greatly
concerned whether he brought the man to justice
or killed him himself, and rather preferred the
latter, for feud was strong in his heart.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I'll have a preliminary hearing?"
he asked the officer.
</p>

<p>
The latter nodded curtly.  "I suppose so.  You
must be formally identified."
</p>

<p>
Hammer asked no more questions.  Ahead of
him were the two small corrugated iron bungalows,
with the flag fluttering gaily before them and the
police huts at one side, while the natives stared
in high glee at a white man being brought to justice.
</p>

<p>
The American grinned cheerfully as he caught
sight of the planter who had assisted him on his
first arrival at Melindi standing in the doorway
of a store; but to his surprise his grin was not
answered in kind.  Instead, the planter darted him a
black look, and Hammer could almost hear the
curse that left his lips as he turned on his heel and
vanished.
</p>

<p>
He had small time to wonder at this, however,
for he was led into one of the iron bungalows which
mark the limitations of British rule in all torrid
lands, and found himself in the presence of the
district commissioner.  The latter was a red-faced
young man who sat at a table writing, with a
whisky bottle on the shelf behind him; two more
of the police were sitting on a bench inside the door,
and these rose in salute as the squad marched
Hammer inside.
</p>

<p>
"This is our man, Mr. Smith!" exclaimed the
police lieutenant, saluting.
</p>

<p>
Commissioner Smith looked at Hammer from a
pair of narrow set eyes and pulled a paper in front
of him with a weary air.
</p>

<p>
"You are Cyrus Hammer, first mate of the yacht
<i>Daphne</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet I am!" shot back Hammer, irritated
by the man's air.  "And I demand to know why I
am under arrest?"
</p>

<p>
"For murder," came the laconic answer, accompanied
by a stare of mild surprise.  "Don't come
that, my man!  Can't get away with it, really,
don't you know!"
</p>

<p>
"Confound it, who have I murdered, you
blithering ass?"
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;er&mdash;oh, yes&mdash;Frederick R. C. Harcourt,
your owner and captain.  And no more insolence,
you cur, or I'll put you in irons, you know."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br /><br />
ACCUSED AND ACCUSER
</h3>

<p>
It was perhaps unfortunate that District
Commissioner Smith had very recently been transferred
from Nairobi for his sins, inasmuch as he knew
not the gods of Melindi and cared not to know them.
</p>

<p>
He was utterly bored by the place, and showed
it plainly: he disliked Americans by instinct and
training and Hammer saw that the question of
his guilt or innocence was of the utmost
indifference to his inquisitor.
</p>

<p>
"Do you plead innocent or guilty to this charge
Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Hammer?"
</p>

<p>
The American tried to collect himself, for the
charge had struck him like a bolt from the blue.
Preposterous as it was, the very absurdity of it
shocked him into quiet coolness.
</p>

<p>
If it was the work of Krausz, as he had
conjectured, then he would eventually hold the
whip-hand, through the testimony of Solomon and Sara
Helmuth; but in the meantime it would do no good
to try and bluster out his innocence.
</p>

<p>
"Not guilty, of course.  I trust that you'll note
that I gave myself up without making a fight?
Does that look as if I was a murderer, Mr. District
Commissioner?"
</p>

<p>
Smith made an entry on the sheet before him,
then looked up.
</p>

<p>
"You'll please bear in mind, Hammer, that
you're not here to ask questions, but to answer
them.  Where were you on the morning of the 14th
instant?"
</p>

<p>
"The 14th?"  Hammer thought back desperately&mdash;ah,
that was the morning of Harcourt's murder!
</p>

<p>
"I was aboard the <i>Daphne</i>, ill with fever."
</p>

<p>
"You deny the fact, then, that you were on the
wharf that morning?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do!  I was brought ashore that day
unconscious, and can bring witnesses to prove it."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!"  For the first time Smith began to show
a trace of interest.  "Their names?"
</p>

<p>
"John Solomon for one.  Miss Sara Helmuth
for another, the doctor who attended me, natives&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Testimony of natives not allowed."  The
commissioner glanced at his police officer.  "Who
is this&mdash;er&mdash;this John Solomon, lieutenant?"
</p>

<p>
The officer hesitated, for he knew Solomon of old.
</p>

<p>
"He is a planter, Mr. Smith.  His place is about
a mile outside town.  I would suggest, sir, that he
be&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Kindly bear in mind that I am conducting this
examination, lieutenant."
</p>

<p>
The latter bit his lip and flushed.  It was plain
that he had no great love for his superior.  The
commissioner turned languidly to Hammer.
</p>

<p>
"Where is this Mr. Solomon?"
</p>

<p>
"Out in the jungle somewhere&mdash;search me.  But
he'll be in soon."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very good!  Lieutenant, you will see that
he appears.  Now, Hammer, what physician&mdash;er&mdash;attended
you?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, but he was the same who signed
Harcourt's death-certificate."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Dr. Fargo&mdash;at present with the <i>Juba</i> at
Mombasa.  Very good.  Well, Hammer, I can't see
that you have any case whatever.  Cheek, I call it.
However, they can settle it at Nairobi, and be
blessed.  Lieutenant, put the prisoner in the&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Look here," Hammer broke out furiously,
"I've had about enough of this farce, Mr. Smith!
Now you bear in mind that I'm an American citizen.
Also that I plead not guilty.  You hand out what
testimony you have against me or I'll make it hot
for you in darned short order; and if I can't I'll
bet a dollar John Solomon can!"
</p>

<p>
The commissioner gazed at him mildly, then
shifted his look to his lieutenant.  What he saw in
the latter's face may have decided him, for with
an air of boredom he shuffled the papers before him,
fixed on the right one, and nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Very good.  You are probably aware of the fact
that according to the death certificate of Mr. Harcourt
he died from a stab at the hands of persons
unknown, complicated by fever.
</p>

<p>
"Since that time it has been reported to the
authorities at Mombasa that you inflicted the wound,
later getting away in the crowd.  It is also known
that you benefited largely by his death, since by
his will you were given ownership of the yacht
<i>Daphne</i>.  Yesterday, you visited Mombasa, getting
away&mdash;er&mdash;secretly before you could be apprehended."
</p>

<p>
"See here, Mr. Smith," exclaimed Hammer
earnestly, "this charge is absolutely absurd.
Not only was Mr. Harcourt my best friend, but I
was ill and unconscious at the time&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Just a moment&mdash;I overlooked that scar on your
forehead," broke in the commissioner, looking up
from his papers.  Hammer put up a hand to the
scar which had resulted from the fight aboard the
launch, "Yes, that is it.  These papers state
that&mdash;er&mdash;it is the result of a blow struck you by
Mr. Harcourt as you stabbed him."
</p>

<p>
"Confound it all," exclaimed the enraged American,
"who's bringing all these charges, anyway?
Dr. Krausz?"
</p>

<p>
For answer the commissioner glanced at his
police officer.
</p>

<p>
"You detained those fellows, lieutenant?"
</p>

<p>
"I did, sir, against their protest."
</p>

<p>
"Damn their protest, my dear chap!  Bring 'em
in.  Since you persist in going through with this
ruddy mess, Hammer, I'll give you all you want
of it."
</p>

<p>
The American asked nothing better, and began
to think that the commissioner was not so bad after
all, having probably been prejudiced against him
from the start.  The police officer, with his sergeant
and two men, left the room, Hammer watching
the door eagerly for their return.
</p>

<p>
Who were these unknown persons?  Whoever
they were, he reflected, they had done their work
well.  The devilish ingenuity of it all was
amazing, and as Hammer never doubted that Krausz
was behind the thing, he began to score up an ugly
debt against the scientist.
</p>

<p>
Except for the evidence which could be brought
by Solomon, Sara Helmuth, and the doctor of the
<i>Juba</i>, all of whom would not be suspected by
Krausz, the identity of Harcourt's murderer was
unknown.
</p>

<p>
Counting on this fact, Krausz must have worked
out the case against Hammer to the last detail&mdash;even
to that scar on his forehead.
</p>

<p>
There was no ultimate danger, of course, but
that was not the fault of Krausz; he must have
reasoned that if Harcourt had disclosed the name
of his attacker before he died, it would have set
the commissioner after Jenson.
</p>

<p>
Therefore he had not disclosed it, and therefore
it was perfectly safe to make out the case against
the American&mdash;and with a plausibility which was
startling to Hammer himself, certain as he was
of disproving the charge absolutely, on the return
of Solomon.
</p>

<p>
Yet, was Krausz so wholly to blame after all?
Could he have known those little things, such as
the scar, and Hammer's ownership of the yacht?
He had been miles away all this time, and while
he must have furnished Jenson with letters to the
German Consul, in order to get the <i>askaris</i>, the little
secretary must have acted on his own initiative
in regard to this charge.
</p>

<p>
Krausz was no saint, but he was a sinner only
because of his life-work, his science; he was no
plotter in the dark, and the very theft which had
brought him here, which had made him bring
Sara Helmuth with him as a sop to a guilty
conscience, was attributable to the secretary, who was
his evil genius.  And that Jenson could act on his
own initiative had been shown after Schlak's
murder.
</p>

<p>
Yes, concluded Hammer grimly, he had a godly
score to settle with Jenson.  Solomon could handle
Krausz, for he had long since constituted himself
the companion of Miss Helmuth, but Jenson was his
own peculiar affair.  And, <i>askaris</i> or no, he was
going to the ruins and get Jenson&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
At this juncture the door opened.  Behind the
policeman entered two of the German sailors from
the <i>Daphne</i>, and behind him Adolf Jenson.
</p>

<p>
Hammer said nothing.  Thoroughly master of
himself by now, he knew the futility of threats,
nor did he want to show Jenson his hand unless it
was necessary.  But he soon found that it was highly
necessary for his own safety.
</p>

<p>
"You are Adolf Jenson?" demanded the
commissioner brusquely.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," and the secretary, more pallid-faced
than ever, let his eyes rest on Hammer's grim face,
caught the flame in the American's eyes, and shifted
his gaze abruptly.
</p>

<p>
Hammer remembered that the lieutenant had
stated that Jenson had remained only under protest.
This, then, was why Solomon had not found him
with the <i>askaris</i> in the bush.  The two seamen
gazed stolidly at the commissioner.
</p>

<p>
"You came ashore with Mr. Harcourt from the
<i>Daphne</i> the morning of the 14th instant, according
to your evidence sworn to at Mombasa?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Who else was with you in the boat?"
</p>

<p>
"These two men, sir, as well as two more,
who are now in camp with Dr. Krausz, my master."
</p>

<p>
"State what happened on the wharf."
</p>

<p>
Jenson licked his lips nervously, but the sight
of Hammer under arrest seemed to give him courage.
He had a red weal across one cheek, which the
American took to be the mark of Sara Helmuth's
bullet, fired during the struggle aboard the launch.
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir, Captain Harcourt had just stepped
ashore.  I was right behind him, sir, and there
was a crowd of Arabs and natives all about for
the <i>Juba</i> had just come in, and a number of
surf-boats had come ashore from her."
</p>

<p>
He paused, the telling of the story being plainly
distasteful to him.  Commissioner Smith nodded
his head, reading one of the papers before him.
</p>

<p>
"The captain was a little ahead of me, for I
had turned to see that a man was left in the boat.
I saw a man wearing a white burnoose step close
to Mr. Harcourt, and the next minute he had
drawn a knife, sir.
</p>

<p>
"Before any of us knew what was happening,
he had stabbed Mr. Harcourt.  The hood of his
burnoose fell off, and I recognized Mr. Hammer
there; then the captain grappled with him and
struck him.  That's the mark over his eye, sir.
It was made by a heavy ring that the captain
always wore."
</p>

<p>
Jenson was an accomplished liar, thought
Hammer grimly.  Harcourt had indeed worn a
heavy seal ring.  Again the man paused, licking
his lips, his face ghastly, and again the
commissioner encouraged him with a nod.
</p>

<p>
"Go on."
</p>

<p>
"He had the hood on again in a minute, sir,
but not before we knew who he was.  As
Mr. Harcourt fell I tried to reach him, but
Mr. Hammer's knife touched my cheek, just here,
sir"&mdash;and Jenson indicated the red weal under his
eye.  "Then, before we could do anything more,
he had slipped away into the crowd.  That's all,
I think, sir."
</p>

<p>
Jenson stepped back toward the door, in evident
relief that his story was done with.  Except for
the two native policemen on the bench, he had
the open doorway to himself, since the lieutenant
had taken his stand behind Hammer, one hand
on his holstered revolver.
</p>

<p>
The American eyed Jenson grimly enough, but
still in silence.  The thought that was in his
mind, occurred to the commissioner at the same
instant.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Jenson," said Smith, looking up
for the first time, "your story agrees with the
facts as brought out by the inquiry at the time,
except that no such evidence was then given
my assistant, who made the inquiry.  I'd like to
know why you and these two men, who I see gave
their testimony in German, went down to the
German Consulate at Mombasa after a week had
passed, instead of coming to me on the spot and
accusing the murderer?"
</p>

<p>
"We were frightened, sir," returned Jenson
promptly.  "Mr. Hammer threatened us a little
later on, when he found that we had recognized
him.  It wouldn't have mattered so much to me,
sir, but the two men here are members of the crew,
and without their testimony mine would not have
been believed, I thought.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hammer threatened to kill them if they
said a word, sir.  I went to the camp of Dr. Krausz,
who sent us at once to Mombasa, and then to
Zanzibar, where we produced a number of <i>askaris</i>
to guard the camp, as you know, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and I've taken that up with Nairobi,
by Jove!"  Smith seemed to wake into life suddenly.
"It's a deucedly funny affair that I have to see
German soldiers walk into my district to protect
a man!  If Mombasa people hadn't agreed to it
not one of 'em would have set foot in Melindi,
and if they aren't kicked out of here inside of
two days I'll hand in my resignation.  Confound
the insolence of you Germans!"
</p>

<p>
He glared at Jenson, who cringed abjectly.
Hammer, who had only been forestalled by the
commissioner's questions in regard to the delay
in giving evidence, smiled grimly across the stuffy
little room at Jenson, and the smile seemed to
discourage the secretary entirely.  Shrinking back,
he pointed at the American, his voice shrill.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to protect me, sir!  He's threatened
to kill me before now, and he carries revolvers&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Did you search that man, lieutenant?" asked
Smith sharply.
</p>

<p>
Before the officer could reply Hammer drew the
two revolvers from his pocket and laid them on
the table, still smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Kindly observe that they are loaded," he said
contemptuously; "also that if I had desired to
make any resistance it could have been done very
easily."
</p>

<p>
Smith cast a single glance at his officer, who bit
his lip again, for he had evidently forgotten about
searching his prisoner for weapons.
</p>

<p>
The Commissioner forbore to make any observation,
however, being plainly highly incensed
over Jenson's action in bringing the <i>askaris</i> into his
district.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, my man, I've a deuced good notion
to send you after those <i>askaris</i> and ship the lot of
you out of here to Mombasa!  Confound it, this
isn't your bally German East Africa by a long shot,
and if you think you can carry things with a high
hand in my district, either you or I go, by Jove!"
</p>

<p>
Jenson did not reply, save by an inarticulate
mutter, and shifted his gaze out of the open
doorway, the two seamen consistently inspecting the
boards of the floor.  Smith turned to Hammer,
gathering up the papers before him as if his task
were done.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Hammer, I trust you are satisfied that
you will get justice done you?  And let us hear
no more 'American citizen' talk&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is it customary here to allow an accused man
to be heard in his own defence?" broke in Hammer
quietly.  He saw that he had started off badly,
and that while Smith did not care a snap about the
outcome of the case, he did care about the dignity
of his position and the brand of justice which he
was there to dispense.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry if I offended you at first, Mr. Smith,
but I didn't quite understand the situation and was
naturally indignant."
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;er&mdash;of course, Hammer," assented the
other, still with his air of boredom, as he prepared
to write.  "Anything you may say, of course.  No
deuced use, though, I'll say frankly: you're bound
to go to Nairobi for this thing&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, then my accusers will go, too, of course?"
</p>

<p>
"Naturally," came the dry response.  "And
under the circumstances I'd advise you to change
your plea there, Hammer."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," smiled the American.  Jenson,
uneasy, was darting swift little glances at him,
but he paid no heed to the secretary.  "But I'd
like to go on record as denying the whole affair,
Mr. Smith.  When does the <i>Juba</i> come in, may I ask?"
</p>

<p>
"She's due to-morrow night, and you'll go back
on her the next morning."
</p>

<p>
Much as he disliked to show Jenson his cards,
Hammer saw that he had no other choice.  He did
not want to leave on the <i>Juba</i>, and he hoped
to delay matters until the arrival of Solomon,
with Sara Helmuth.
</p>

<p>
If only Potbelly, or Omar ibn Kasim, rather,
had understood that last signal of his!  Surely
Solomon could not be so very far away by now.
</p>

<p>
"You still deny the accusation, then?" the
commissioner was asking, with some surprise in
his tone.
</p>

<p>
"Most certainly, sir.  Not only do I deny the
charge, but through the evidence of Mr. Solomon,
Miss Helmuth, and Dr. Fargo of the <i>Juba</i>, who
stayed over here, as you are aware, to attend
Mr. Harcourt, I am prepared to prove that not
only was I unconscious at the time of the attack on
Mr. Harcourt, but that I was on board the <i>Daphne</i>.
</p>

<p>
"If necessary, Roberts, the yacht's steward,
can be brought out from England to testify to that
fact, since he caught the first steamer home with
certain of Mr. Harcourt's personal possessions.
Furthermore, through the same evidence&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Hammer paused, unwilling to lay out his whole
hand as yet.  The commissioner was staring at
him in blank amazement, while Jenson, more
pallid-faced than ever, was still looking nervously
out the doorway.  Smith laughed as the American
stopped speaking.
</p>

<p>
"That's a poor game, don't you know, Hammer!"
he said incredulously.  "You can't produce
your witnesses, it seems, and you're making a
play for time that'll do you no good in the end.
Now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Jenson interrupted, coming a pace
forward.
</p>

<p>
"Beg pardon, sir, but if you think it would be a
good plan I can get a launch at the wharfs and fetch
these other two witnesses of mine, sir, in time to
catch the <i>Juba</i>.  Their testimony would clinch
matters, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," and Smith nodded, pursing up his lips.
"That's a good plan.  Go ahead&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Stop him!" cried Hammer sharply, as Jenson
sidled toward the door.  He could not make out the
secretary's purpose, but it was clear that Jenson
was anxious to get away.  "I charge that man with
being Mr. Harcourt's murderer&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Enough, Hammer," ordered the commissioner
coldly.  "Another word and you go in handcuffs.
Get your witnesses, Jenson, and be back here by
to-morrow night at latest."
</p>

<p>
Furious, barely able to restrain himself, the
American saw Jenson flit hastily from the door,
leaving his two Germans still on the spot.
</p>

<p>
From his position he was unable to see the street,
and five minutes had elapsed during which time
Smith was giving instructions as to the care of the
two seamen and preparing his papers, until he
ordered Hammer taken to the little corrugated
iron prison.
</p>

<p>
He stopped the officer to order him to get John
Solomon as a witness when Hammer heard the
sentry outside halt some person.
</p>

<p>
"See who it is, sergeant," commanded Smith
impatiently.
</p>

<p>
The sergeant went out, but came back hurriedly.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. John Solomon, sar."
</p>

<p>
And a moment later the overjoyed American
saw the pudgy form of Solomon enter, with the
grinning Omar Ibn Kasim at his heels like a faithful
watchdog.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br /><br />
OFF AT LAST
</h3>

<p>
"Dang it, but it be a mortal 'ot day!"
</p>

<p>
Solomon, with his mild observation, paused to
mop his brow with a flaming red handkerchief.
Instantly offended, Smith snapped out a curt
question.
</p>

<p>
"Your business with me, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Solomon looked up, his blue eyes widening in
surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Why, dang it, if it ain't the new commissioner
as I 'aven't met yet!  Werry pleased I am to meet
you, sir, and 'ere's 'oping as 'ow we'll get on well
in future, as the old gent said to the new
'ousemaid.  Me name's Solomon, sir, John Solomon."
</p>

<p>
"So I understand.  Your business?"
</p>

<p>
Solomon once more seemed surprised, then
looked around and nodded to Hammer.
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir, I 'eard as 'ow me friend, Mr. 'Ammer,
was 'ere, so I says to meself: 'John,' says
I, 'don't refuse a 'elping 'and to a friend!  'Elping
'ands is cheap,' I says; 'but friends is werry 'ard
to find.'  So 'ere I be, sir, 'oping as 'ow you'll
see fit to let Mr. 'Ammer go with me."
</p>

<p>
"You're a very innocent person," came the
brusque reply.  "Mr. Hammer is accused of murder,
and does not go <i>with</i> you."
</p>

<p>
"Lud!  Murder!  And who's 'e been and murdered,
if I may make so bold, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Hammer grinned to himself, though inwardly
worried over Jenson.  Had the man seen Solomon
coming?
</p>

<p>
"He's accused of murdering Mr. Harcourt, who
died at your house not long ago."
</p>

<p>
"Lud!  To think o' that!"  Solomon fixed the
commissioner with his wide blue stare, seemingly
as harmless as a baby's, then shifted it to the
officer.  "Your servant, lieutenant, sir!  Mr. Smith,
might I 'ave bit o' speech with you in the
other room, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"You may not.  By the way, lieutenant, better
make sure of getting Mr. Solomon as witness in
this case I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Beggin' your pardon, sir; but if so be as you
'as the time, I'd like a bit o' speech with you in
the other room."
</p>

<p>
Smith looked up, raging at Solomon's calm
persistency.
</p>

<p>
"Confound your deuced insolence, sir!" he
began.  "Do you think&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever 'appen to 'ear, sir," and the
wide blue eyes narrowed a trifle, "as 'ow this
station come wacant?  Werry unforchnit it was,
sir, for the gentleman as was 'ere before you.
Lieutenant, your servant; if so be as you'd say
a word to Mr. Smith&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I really think, sir," said the police officer
dryly, "that it would be wise to grant
Mr. Solomon's request."
</p>

<p>
Smith glared from one to the other, while
Hammer chuckled.  Then, as Solomon very calmly
drew out clay pipe and plug, the commissioner
sprang to his feet and whirled into the other room.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Solomon."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir," and as Solomon passed the
lieutenant of police, Hammer caught an almost
imperceptible wink.
</p>

<p>
What transpired in the other room Hammer
never knew.  For a long ten minutes those in
the outer room listened to the hum of voices;
then the commissioner reappeared, his face very
red indeed.
</p>

<p>
"Lieutenant, put those two Dutchmen in cells
and keep them there," he ordered succinctly, and
sat down at his table while Solomon came out.
For another few moments he wrote rapidly, then
passed the paper to Solomon, who scrutinized it
carefully and signed.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry this mistake occurred, Mr. Hammer,"
and the commissioner turned to him with extended
hand, which the American grasped.  "You'll have
to go to Nairobi, of course; but I've accepted
Mr. Solomon's bond for your appearance there.
By Jove!  Sergeant, take two men and get down
to the wharfs; stop that fellow Jenson and bring
him up here.  We'll land him for perjury,
Solomon!"
</p>

<p>
"Werry good, sir; and if so be as all's well,
Mr. 'Ammer and I will bid you good day.  We'll
be back werry shortly, I 'opes, sir."
</p>

<p>
Once more in the free air, Hammer's first thought
was for Jenson.  As he started after the sergeant
Solomon stopped him with a quiet chuckle and
pointed out to a dot at the river-mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Too late, sir.  But there ain't no 'urry,
Mr. 'Ammer.  There's a mortal lot in what the Arabs
say about fate, sir; and if so be as a man's turned
to evil ways, sir, then 'e's got to run 'is course,
I says.  Don't you fret, Mr. 'Ammer, we're
a-going to send that 'ound to 'ell, sir."
</p>

<p>
To his surprise, the pudgy man led the way
to the river, with Omar trailing after them, and, as
they went, Solomon explained matters somewhat.
</p>

<p>
When he had left with Omar, the day before,
he had missed the trail of Jenson and the <i>askaris</i>,
owing to the fact that Jenson had been fetched
back to Melindi by the police.
</p>

<p>
The <i>askaris</i> had perforce come with him, but
had been sent on to the camp by launch, with a
native for guide.  Solomon had left no word of
his whereabouts because he wanted Hammer at
the plantation house where he could find him at
a moment's notice.
</p>

<p>
No such restrictions had been placed on the
two Afghans, however, since he was anxious to
see them.  Accordingly, having found out from
the servants the direction in which Solomon had
started, they had slipped out during the night
and come to meet him.
</p>

<p>
Not until after sending Omar to bring Hammer
did Solomon find out from a party of natives that
he was on the wrong scent, so he had promptly
turned back, to be joined by Omar and brought
to the commissioner's office in the nick of time.
</p>

<p>
"No such thing," returned Solomon to a remark
by Hammer&mdash;"no such thing as coincidence,
Mr. 'Ammer.  Just the way things work out, I say.
When the time comes to get that 'ound Jenson,
why, we'll get 'im, sir, and not till then."
</p>

<p>
"Where's Sara Helmuth?" asked the American.
</p>

<p>
"Right 'ere, sir," and Solomon pointed to the
wharf ahead.  Then Hammer saw that his own
<i>Daphne</i> launch and another were lying ready,
filled with Arabs; in the first was seated Sara
Helmuth, who left the shade of the awning to
meet them as they came down the wharf.
</p>

<p>
"A fair jewel, the missus is," but Solomon
lowered his tone as he went on.  "I came to get
you off, sir, while she took charge o' this 'ere.
And werry well done it is, sir!  Off we goes after
Jenson."
</p>

<p>
Few words passed between Hammer and the
girl, to whom the story was told as they chugged
out into the lines of surf and headed to the north.
Quiet and self-contained as always, she had brought
down the men and provisioned the launches while
Solomon had gone on to the commissioner's.
</p>

<p>
With the three of them beneath the awning
sat the two Afghans, who greeted Hammer with
grave dignity, while Omar had taken command of
the other launch.
</p>

<p>
In all, there were some fifteen Arabs in both
craft&mdash;and after leaving Melindi behind, fifteen
very excellent Winchester rifles mysteriously
appeared, with all the appurtenances belonging
thereto.
</p>

<p>
Hammer suddenly appreciated the fact that
these men were very different from the chattering
natives, and were apt to be dangerous.  When
Solomon explained that his plan was to land
Sara Helmuth and five men a mile this side of
the ruins that they might join the Arabs behind
the doctor's party, while he and Hammer would
go straight for the camp with the other ten, the
American voiced his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"All very well, John; but wait a minute.  Those
two Germans back there at Melindi were the same
two I kicked off the yacht.  Jenson found them
and didn't have much trouble persuading them
to swear to his lies, evidently.  But that only
goes to show what a hold he and Krausz have on
their men.  There are eight <i>askaris</i> and six seamen
up at the ruins now&mdash;fourteen in all, with Krausz
and Jenson.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not afraid of being outnumbered, since
we've got it all over them there; but I am afraid
of a general row, and no mistake.  If we get into
a shooting scrape and half a dozen men get laid
out, these Britishers will give it to us hot and
heavy for going after Jenson on our own hook,
to say nothing of the danger to Sara&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"One minute, Mr. 'Ammer, sir.  I'm werry
strong wi' the governor, sir, and the government
generally, so to speak, so I wouldn't worry none
about a-shooting of all fourteen o' them 'ere men,
wi' the doctor into the bargain, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Mind, I don't say to 'unt any such mess,
Mr. 'Ammer; but if it comes&mdash;why, I says to
meet it half-way.  This 'ere's a partnership deal,
sir&mdash;you for Jenson and me for the doctor; but
so be as 'e gets out peaceable, why, let 'im go.
What be you a-going to do wi' this Jenson?"
</p>

<p>
"Take him back to the <i>Daphne</i> and string him
up, and explain to the authorities afterward,"
announced Hammer.  "I'd have brought the
engine-room crew if I'd known we were to go after
Krausz hammer and tongs, like this.  If Jenson
resists, I'll shoot him."
</p>

<p>
To which intention Sara Helmuth made no
objection whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
Now for the first time Solomon had a chance
to interview his Afghans, for they had all been
too worn out the night before to have any talk.
The result of their mission, which Yar Hussein
announced with no little pride, was embodied
in the little sheepskin packet he had carried.
</p>

<p>
This, being opened, proved to contain some very
well-copied plans which Akhbar Khan had located
among the archives&mdash;though he did not say where
or how.  He was the locater and Yar Hussein
the draftsman, it seemed, and the work had been
copied line for line and word for word, even to
the early seventeenth-century Portuguese text.
</p>

<p>
Solomon held them in his lap, Sara Helmuth
and Hammer leaning over his shoulders as they
inspected the plans and he explained them.  The
first was a rude map of the coast, which clearly
showed the location of the fort and storehouses and
barracoons; when erected, the latter buildings had
been well defended by the position of the fort
itself, though the coast seemed to have changed
greatly.
</p>

<p>
There were three others showing the Melindi&mdash;spelled
"Maleenda"&mdash;buildings, which Solomon
tossed aside, but at the fifth and last he uttered
a grunt of satisfaction.  This, to Hammer's surprise,
was labelled Fort San Joao.
</p>

<p>
"That 'ere was its first name," explained
Solomon knowingly.  "Accordin' to them papers
o' Professor 'Elmuth's, it was changed to Fort
St. Thomas after its destruction.  You see, sir
and miss, some o' them 'ere relics belonged to
Saint Thomas&mdash;Didymus, I doubt it was&mdash;and
as they was never dug up again the name just
stuck to the place, so to speak.  This 'ere'd be
the place for Jenson, Mr. 'Ammer," and he chuckled
again as he laid his finger on one of the squares
in the corner of the plan.
</p>

<p>
As Solomon had told them before, the fort
was merely a group of buildings with a wall around,
much as were the barracoons and warehouses for
less valuable goods.  The corner to which he pointed
was that farthest away from shore, and seemed
to be separated from the fort proper by the angle
of the corner bastion.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked the girl.  "What was that, John?"
</p>

<p>
"This 'ere, miss, was a little room set above
the ground, according to the plan.  It was a
prison&mdash;them Portuguese were main cruel, which was
why they didn't last&mdash;and under this 'ere room
was a stone pit full o' puff-adders."
</p>

<p>
Solomon went on to say that he had not seen
this room when there before, as there was too
much jungle to inspect the place closely; but
the text, with the plans, explained its purpose
fully.
</p>

<p>
In fact, it was not until a native king had
perished in this snake-pit that the place was finally
attacked and razed, with the help of the fleet
from Muscat which had already taken Port Jesus,
or Mombasa.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, Hammer recollected Omar's wild
tales about monkeys throwing skulls at him and
pits full of snakes, and related what he could of
the man's story.
</p>

<p>
Solomon nodded gravely, saying that there
might still be snakes there, though the monkeys
were probably imagination, and fully reassured
Sara Helmuth that she would be in no danger
through joining his Arabs and making camp in
the ruins; and, in any case, puff-adders would
hardly be encountered outside the pit.
</p>

<p>
Upon which, with the air of a man who has
played his part exceeding well, Solomon stated
that he was in need of rest and would take a nap
until the run was finished.
</p>

<p>
Hammer had seen no sign of Jenson's launch
ahead, for he had no glasses, and the secretary
had obtained a good start.  When Solomon had
curled up on the bottom beneath the thwarts
the American sat beside Sara Helmuth in the
stern, as they had sat on that eventful night that
seemed ages ago, when Baumgardner had paid for
treachery with his life.
</p>

<p>
"Talk about Arabian Nights," laughed Hammer
grimly, glancing back at Omar's launch in their
wake, "I guess this is the limit, Sara!  I've half
a notion to use that snake-pit on Jenson after&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't, please!"  She shivered despite the heat,
then met his gaze and smiled.  "I know you didn't
mean it, Hammer, but it sounded anything but
nice.  Now tell me&mdash;I have been thinking about
something during the past few days, and I wonder
if&mdash;if this man Jenson could have had anything
to do with my father's death?"
</p>

<p>
Hammer stared at her, trouble in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  The man is a regular viper;
but though it has occurred to me, also, I rather
fancy that he's not guilty of that, Sara.  You
see, he's hardly the sort of man who commits
murder except when he's panic-stricken&mdash;a cornered
rat, exactly, even to his face.  He murdered
Mohammed Bari in the hope of getting away
from me, and he murdered Harcourt in blind
panic, thinking he was discovered."
</p>

<p>
The girl looked pensive, and said:
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad you think that, Hammer; because,
while I'm afraid I hate the man as much as you
do, if I thought he had injured father in any way,
I don't know just what I would do.  No, I think
you're right.  He started out by lying about that
horrible murder on board your yacht, didn't he?
And he just got in deeper and deeper through his
desperate efforts to get out until&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Until he's in too deep to ever get out now,"
concluded Hammer.  "Shouldn't wonder if John's
right in his doctrine of Kismet.  Jenson's whole
life, little and mean and full of lies, has been
leading him up to this very point, it would seem.
He hasn't met his punishment yet, but it's mighty
close, seems to me."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  But isn't that always the way, Hammer?
Isn't a man's life, and a woman's, always slowly
leading up to some great moment?  It has always
seemed to me like a mosaic, in which every little
action fits like a stone&mdash;insignificant in itself, and
yet giving its tiny detail to the making of the
whole, until the great moment of highest power or
highest failure comes.
</p>

<p>
"It may not be very high, but I think it comes
to everyone, banker or grocer's clerk, and whether
it is power or failure depends largely on the structure
of the mosaic.  How do you like my philosophy?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid it's very true," returned Hammer
slowly, his voice low, his eyes gazing straight
over the bow of the launch.  Something in his
tone struck the girl, for the underlying earnestness in
her own voice crept into her eyes as she watched him.
</p>

<p>
The American's thoughts were not pleasant.
It came to him that this argument of hers was
indeed very sound, and he quailed before it.
Jenson's whole life had been leading up to his
greatest villainy; his own entire life had been
leading up to&mdash;what?  So with other men he knew,
and women.
</p>

<p>
So with his own wife&mdash;her life a tissue of trifles,
of petty vanities and unworthy ambitions, until
it had culminated in finding a man after her own
stamp, and her preferment of him to her husband.
</p>

<p>
Little things, all of them, yet when united all
led irrevocably to some great valley of decision.
Why, this serious-eyed girl had hit to the very
heart of things!
</p>

<p>
So, never looking at her, he told her his story.
</p>

<p>
She listened, half-fascinated by the virility of
him, half-awed by the fact that she had pierced
to his soul unthinkingly.  She watched the
fine-lined face, whose rare smiles swept away its
harshness; the clear eyes that frowned into the blaze
of afternoon sun; the firm, almost too firm, mouth
and chin and nose.
</p>

<p>
And as she watched, harkening to his low words,
the faintest trace of a smile touched her lips,
though in her eyes there was only a great compassion.
</p>

<p>
"So, you see, you hit near home, Sara," he
concluded.  "What my great moment will be there
is no telling; but if it were to come soon I would
be afraid&mdash;yes, afraid to meet it, I think.  Harcourt
met his great moment with a clean heart, like
the splendid man he was; but my little moments
have not been so good, so open to all the world,
so fearless and honest as his."
</p>

<p>
She was silent an instant; then, "But they
have been strong, Hammer!  And better a devil
than a fool!  No; when that great moment of
yours arrives I think it will be one of power, not
of failure; I would like to see what happens when
it does come."
</p>

<p>
A sudden blaze outbroke in the man, and he
turned; but the words on his lips were interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"'Ere!  'Ere!  Dang it, you've been and passed
the place!"
</p>

<p>
Startled, he looked around to see Solomon
awakened and hastily gaining his feet.  It seemed
that Hammer had passed the intended landing-place
of Sara Helmuth by a good half-mile, very
nearly reaching that of himself and Solomon, in
fact; for, looking ahead, he could see a launch
anchored and rocking lazily to the swells, while
on the shore was the deserted boat.
</p>

<p>
He swept his launch around, bidding Omar
shut oft power and wait where he was.  As they
had no boat, Solomon went into the bow and
conned the shoal-water until, at his cry, Hammer
shut off the engine.
</p>

<p>
A swift order sent five of the men over the side,
up to their knees in water; and these took up Sara
Helmuth and carried her to shore, where all
vanished amid the trees a moment later, after
a last wave of the hand.
</p>

<p>
"All right, Mr. 'Ammer!" cried Solomon,
relaxing.  "They'll be in camp in an hour, God
willing."
</p>

<p>
"And in less than that time we'll either have
our friend Jenson ready for the rope, or else we'll
have a sweet scrap on our hands," added the
American.  But he was now thankful to John Solomon,
for that sudden awakening had saved him from
words which he might have sorely regretted.
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later the launch was at anchor,
and Hammer, lowering himself from the arms
of his bearers, saw the path to the ruins directly
ahead of him.

Hammer was by no means certain as to the
attitude of Dr. Sigurd Krausz, and he was very
certain indeed as to the attitude of the British
East African officials.  He knew that if he played
a waiting game for a day or so, District Commissioner
Smith would see to it that the scientist's
force was disrupted and the <i>askaris</i> transported
home, and his recent elbow-brush with the law
had shown him very vividly that men do not
die in East Africa without investigations, and
reasonably thorough ones at that.
</p>

<p>
Wherefore, with the flame of vengeance no whit
undimmed, but burning in the lamp of caution,
he waited for Solomon to land the rest of the Arabs
and the two Afghans, who had also been given
rifles.
</p>

<p>
"Going to take the men up with us, John?
It might be wiser not to make any display of arms
until we see what Krausz intends to do."
</p>

<p>
Solomon nodded, and spoke in Arabic:
</p>

<p>
"Keep the men here, Omar.  We'll be back
before sunset."
</p>

<p>
"And if you do not come, <i>effendi</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Then see that no one from the other party
reaches their boats, but do not fire the first shot.
If there is a fight, your task will be to cut them
off from escape."
</p>

<p>
Mopping his streaming brow&mdash;for there was
not a breath of wind&mdash;Solomon turned to the
American.
</p>

<p>
"If so be as you're ready, sir?  It don't seem
as 'ow there'd be any trouble, Mr. 'Ammer; so
we'll not take any arms, if it's the same to you,
sir.  Guns is all werry well in their place, I says;
but if men wasn't so danged anxious to be carryin'
of 'em there wouldn't be so many cartridges
wasted, says I.  So we'll go gentle like and meet
the doctor 'alf-way, so to speak."
</p>

<p>
Hammer handed back the rifle he had taken from
Yar Hussein, and nodded.  Knowing the path up
to the ruins, he plunged into the opening; but
Solomon insisted on going ahead, fearing that
Jenson might be lying in wait and might go crazed
with fear again at sight of the American.
</p>

<p>
The latter laughed, and gave way, and he was
surprised at the agility with which Solomon
clambered along, for the pudgy little man gave
no great evidence of bodily activity to a casual
eye.  Remembering the episode of Hans Schlak,
however, Hammer decided to suspend judgement.
He had already found John Solomon highly
surprising in more ways than one.
</p>

<p>
Though he watched the jungle keenly as they
proceeded, he could detect no sign of danger.  But
surely Jenson must have known that he would be
followed, and Krausz would not be fool enough
to put out no sentries!
</p>

<p>
Nor was he, as the American found out soon
enough.  They had covered perhaps half the trail,
and had just crossed an open space amid the
bamboo thickets, when Solomon, four yards ahead
of Hammer, vanished around an abrupt turn in
the trail.
</p>

<p>
The American pushed hastily after him, and
upon rounding the same bend was brought up in
startling fashion.
</p>

<p>
Solomon had halted, and directly in front of
him Hammer saw Dr. Krausz calmly seated on
a camp-stool, with that murderous, double-barrelled
shot-gun of his covering the approach.
So, then, their launch had been seen!  Behind
the doctor stood two gigantic Masai <i>askaris</i>, their
black faces stolid.
</p>

<p>
For a moment, Krausz looked at the two men
before him, his heavy face impassive, but that
ribbon of muscle beating, beating, beating
endlessly on his brow.  He was perfectly sober, the
American was glad to note, though none the less
dangerous on that account; and when at last
he broke the silence his voice was impassive as
his face, as though he were exercising a great
restraint upon himself.
</p>

<p>
"So you have come back, Mr. Hammer!  And
what are you doing in this man's company,
Mr. Solomon&mdash;you who used to work for Professor
Helmuth, yess?"
</p>

<p>
In his last words contempt flashed out, but
Solomon's eyes only opened a trifle wider as he
met the sullen, menacing gaze of Krausz.  By
tacit consent Hammer allowed his companion to
do the talking.
</p>

<p>
Solomon's answer was characteristic, however.
Before replying, he put a hand inside his coat,
paying no heed to the swift movement of the doctor's
shot-gun, and drew out his red, morocco-bound
notebook.  Then, wetting his thumb, he opened
it and shuffled over the leaves until he found the
place desired.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, 'ere it be, all ship-shape and proper!"  He
held it out, and Krausz took it, but without
relaxing his vigilance.  At a word from him the
two Masai brought up their rifles while he glanced
down at the notebook.
</p>

<p>
"Werry sorry I am, Dr. Krausz, sir," went on
the little man apologetically, "for to bring this
'ere account to your notice, but you asked a
question, sir, and so I answers according.  If
a man can't tell 'is business honest like, I says,
why, 'e ain't no business 'aving any business,
says I.  If you'll just turn over the page, sir,
I made so bold as to set down Mr. 'Ammer's
account wi' Jenson, keepin' same separate <i>and</i>
distinct from the account o' Solomon and 'Elmuth."
</p>

<p>
But Krausz was paying no heed to the words.
As he read, his heavy jaw snapped shut, and a
dark flush rose slowly to his brow, where the
muscle was pulsating terribly.
</p>

<p>
Deeper and deeper grew the flush, though he
forced himself to turn over the page and read to
the end; then, with a swift movement, he dashed
the notebook down and sprang up with fists
extending and shaking, the shot-gun slipping
unheeded to the ground.
</p>

<p>
"Swine!" he roared, furious almost beyond
control.  "Swine!"
</p>

<p>
Hammer prepared for anything as Krausz
advanced, for one blow from the big man would
put him or Solomon in hospital.  The latter,
however, only gave Krausz a reproachful glance
and bent over to pick up the notebook, without
heeding the great fists which waved about his
head.  The action seemed to both puzzle and calm
the infuriated archaeologist.
</p>

<p>
"It iss foolishness!" he foamed, yet looked
curiously at Solomon.  "Thiss Professor Helmuth,
she iss crazy, no?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," retorted Solomon simply; "no more'n
I be, sir.  You see, doctor, I was in partnership
with 'er father, in a manner o' speakin', and 'e
wrote me a letter before 'e went and died, 'e
did."
</p>

<p>
"What?"  Krausz controlled himself, swept the
brutishness out of his face, and concentrated his
keen energies on John Solomon's personality.
"You were my supercargo, yess?  Then you were
a spy, also!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, so to speak.  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Krausz interrupted with a brusk gesture as he
turned his broad back.
</p>

<p>
"Come."
</p>

<p>
Solomon and Hammer followed him, the two
<i>askaris</i> falling in behind.  Hammer was not at
all convinced that Krausz did not intend treachery,
but there was no help for it, and he followed,
wondering if Sara Helmuth had by this time joined
forces with Solomon's Arabs behind the camp.
</p>

<p>
He could not know what was in Krausz's mind,
or if the scientist had by this time heard of
Harcourt's death.  It was possible, indeed, that
Jenson had carried his trickery through to the
extent of deceiving his master, though Krausz
was not a man to be easily deceived.
</p>

<p>
Now the camp hove in sight ahead, and to his
surprise Hammer saw that work on the ruins
had been abandoned.  More, the hastily-constructed
huts of the natives seemed deserted, while
the sailor-overseers were sitting idly beneath a
large tree.
</p>

<p>
But, on the hill-top above, he could see an
<i>askari</i> standing sentinel, while five more were
scattered about the camp.  Of Jenson there was
no sign, and Hammer guessed rightly enough
that the secretary was inside the doctor's tent.
</p>

<p>
"This is great state in which to receive poor
wayfarers," said Hammer dryly.  "Ready for our
ultimatum, doctor?"
</p>

<p>
The other strode on without answering, curtly
bade them wait, disappeared within his own
tent, and emerged a moment later with one of
his black panatelas smoking mightily.
</p>

<p>
Already irritated by the manner of their reception,
the American suddenly found himself furiously
angry, and flung off the hand of the ever-watchful
Solomon without ceremony.
</p>

<p>
"No, you've said your say, John, and got
nothing for it.  I'll talk to this brute and show
him that we mean business."
</p>

<p>
With which he strode up to Krausz grimly and
delivered his "ultimatum" without any
preliminaries.
</p>

<p>
"You mind your eye, Krausz!  You're here
after stealing a girl's property and trying to bluff
her with threats, but I'm not calling you to account
for that.  You're shielding a murderer here, and
I want him.  You tried to shelter him once before
and got what was coming to you, but you hand
over Jenson now or you'll learn what's what in a
very different way."
</p>

<p>
"Who hass he murdered?"  The other eyed him,
puffing calmly.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Harcourt, and I guess you know it!"
</p>

<p>
"And," Solomon came forward with something
in his manner that was almost boldness, surprising
Hammer greatly, "I'd like to say, doctor, as 'ow
you'd better move out of 'ere werry quick, like.
A man as'll steal from a lady, I says, ain't to
be trusted nohow.  It's 'uman nature to steal,
I says, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Be quiet!" broke out Krausz, losing his calm.
"How iss thiss?  You say that Jenson killed
Mr. Harcourt?  That iss a lie!  A damnable lie!"  He
glared at them, overlooking entirely the charges
of Solomon.
</p>

<p>
"Well, do something," suggested the American
challengingly.  "Hand him over or refuse, one of
the two."
</p>

<p>
"Wait," and Krausz pointed to the tent of
Sara Helmuth.  "Go in there, both of you, and
in the morning&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not on your life," and Hammer took a step
forward threateningly.  "You make up your mind
right here and now, Krausz.  I don't give a
whoop which you do&mdash;all I want to know is&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Go," repeated the other, displaying no other
emotion than the pulsating ribbon of muscle.  "Go,
or my <i>askaris</i> take their whips to you, and shoot
if you refuse, yess!  Now go."
</p>

<p>
Hammer, breathing hard, saw an <i>askari</i> approach,
trailing the long lash of a rhinoceros-hide whip
behind him, two others standing with rifles ready.
</p>

<p>
"Then you will give us your decision in the
morning, doctor?" asked Solomon rather humbly.
Krausz flung him a swift look of contempt.
</p>

<p>
"Yess, to you and Mr. Hammer both.  Go!"
</p>

<p>
Solomon turned and went.  Hammer hesitated,
but seeing that they were practically prisoners,
turned and followed.
</p>

<p>
At anyrate, thought the angry American, the
enemy had taken the offensive and had only
himself to blame for what followed.
</p>

<p>
An escape that night, or a signal to the Arabs,
who were, no doubt, aware of what was forward,
and Krausz would find himself up against something
solid.
</p>

<p>
But Solomon had no intention of either escaping
or signalling, as he flatly stated when Hammer
had exhausted his arguments.  The other, sucking
his clay pipe, accepted the situation very
complacently.
</p>

<p>
"What better could we 'ave asked, Mr. 'Ammer?
''Ere,' says 'e, 'I'll give you me answer in the
morning.'  'Werry good,' says I.  'E can't get away,
nor can Jenson.  Nor, for the matter o' that,
can we; but 'e thinks as 'ow our men are down
by the shore and 'e don't know about them as
Miss 'Elmuth 'as.  It wasn't worry as made
Methusalum live longer'n most men, sir, as the
Good Book says."
</p>

<p>
Hammer grunted, but knowing the hopelessness
of trying to shake Solomon's conviction, said no
more.  His eagerness to get hold of the man was
accentuated a thousandfold by Jenson's nearness,
yet he could see that there was some reason in
Solomon's argument.
</p>

<p>
Also, two <i>askaris</i> brought in their supper before
long, and since they were to eat alone, Hammer
pitched in and made a good meal, feeling more
comfortable over a pipe afterward.
</p>

<p>
In any case, they had Krausz on the hip, what
with the men watching the boats and the second
party in the ruins of the real fort.
</p>

<p>
For that matter, he need not be made to move;
they could settle down and dig up the treasure,
as Solomon had hinted, without the Germans
knowing anything at all about it.
</p>

<p>
What Hammer did not know was that the reading
of that notebook and Solomon's words about
stealing from a lady had sent a desperate and
terrible fear through the big Saxon.
</p>

<p>
It was not the fear of bodily ill, but it was the
fear of the scientist who sees that thing for which
he has worked and planned and bartered his soul
suddenly about to be snatched from him.
</p>

<p>
It is a bad fear to have place in a man's heart,
but worse when that man is able and determined
and when he has staked much upon the issue.
</p>

<p>
"What's become of the natives?" asked Hammer
when they were about to turn in.  "Krausz had
about two hundred of 'em the last time I was
here."
</p>

<p>
Solomon chuckled.  "I sent 'em word to be
gone 'ome, sir.  They worship some kind o' snake
god 'ereabouts, Mr. 'Ammer, so I sent 'em a
quiet 'int that the doctor 'e was a-goin' to sacrifice
some of 'em.  That settled it."
</p>

<p>
"Snake god?" repeated the American thoughtfully.
"Anything to do with that den of snakes
we were talking about?"
</p>

<p>
"Not as I knows on, sir.  To be downright
frank, it's some years since I've been and lived
'ere, sir, and I ain't kept in touch rightly wi'
things.  'Owsoever, it may be, though I 'as me
doubts."
</p>

<p>
"Snakes don't live without food," retorted
Hammer.  "They might have a sort of voodoo
business along here, which would explain their
snake god and also why the snakes had kept
alive&mdash;for I guess Omar ibn Kasim was telling the
truth after all, in part."
</p>

<p>
Leaving to the morning the question whether
they were to be hostages or captives or free men,
Hammer slept the sleep of the just that night.
They were wakened to receive an early breakfast,
which was soon followed by the intimation that
"Bwana Krausz" wished to see them in the other
tent.  Solomon nodded, but stopped Hammer
as the latter was preparing to follow the Masai.
</p>

<p>
"Just a minute, sir.  It strikes me that you
'ave a way to make 'im give up Jenson, if so be
as 'e refuses, Mr. 'Ammer."
</p>

<p>
"Eh?  How's that?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, 'e don't know about the real fort, and
no more 'e don't know as Jenson 'as 'fessed up
to Miss 'Elmuth about them there papers 'e stole
from 'er father.  Jenson 'asn't been and told 'im,
you can lay to that, sir!  'E'll be fair mad when
'e finds it out."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if it comes to that, we'll make him give
in," returned the American slowly.  "But I don't
fancy the method, John, and that's a fact.  I'm
sore at that big Dutchman for his general conduct,
and I'd like to make him crawl without using
any such side-issues.  But we'll see what turns
up; it's certainly a good card to hold."
</p>

<p>
They found Krausz seated at the table in his
own tent, two <i>askaris</i> at the door, and two more
of the seamen within call.  At one side sat Jenson,
who was very plainly possessed by one of his
cowardly fits, and who contented himself with
darting a venomous glance at the two as they
entered.
</p>

<p>
Krausz motioned Solomon to one side and
transfixed Hammer with a baleful stare, at which
the American grew angry instantly.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" he rasped out, "what have you to say?"
</p>

<p>
"Thiss, my friend.  I have found out who killed
Mr. Harcourt.  He wass a good man, and a good
captain, and I am sorry.  Adolf did not kill him,
but you did, and for that you shall hang by the
neck, yess.  Ass for taking Adolf away, that iss
foolishness.  Adolf shall take you, yess."
</p>

<p>
Hammer collected himself, for he had
half-expected such a counter accusation from the
secretary, who was desperately endeavouring to
weave such a network of lies about the death of
Harcourt that he might be able ultimately to
wriggle out through some loophole.  Angry as the
American was, he laughed shortly.
</p>

<p>
"Suit yourself, Krausz.  Adolf never goes away
from here except in irons, though.  So, now that
you've settled me so neatly, what about Mr. Solomon?"
</p>

<p>
Krausz turned to Solomon, who looked very
wide-eyed at him.
</p>

<p>
"As for you, Mr. Solomon, I do not like people
with notebooks, no.  You also are a very big liar,
and to a bad end you will come.  I might prosecute
you for blackmail, but no.  Out you shall go, but
do not think you can&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bwana</i>!"
</p>

<p>
A sudden disturbance arose outside, followed by
a shout in German.  One of the seamen entered and
made a hurried speech in that language, to which
the doctor nodded, looking slightly surprised.  The
man hurried out again.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I thought we saw you land Miss Helmuth
yesterday, yess!"  He beamed on the American,
caressing the thin cigar in his mouth, and his face
was cruel.  "Also I thought she would not stay out
in the jungle long, for here she iss!"
</p>

<p>
Hammer started.  Was Sara really coming,
then?  She or Omar must have seen that he and
Solomon were prisoners, of course, but it was a mad
thing to come in and throw away their best chance
of rescue!
</p>

<p>
He flung a despairing glance at Solomon, which
fetched a chuckle from Krausz, but Solomon merely
stared like a surprised baby and kept silence.
</p>

<p>
Of course the girl would lead out her men and
make what show of force she could, thought
Hammer, edging around to get a view of the ground
immediately outside the tent.
</p>

<p>
With fifteen men here, and ten more under
Omar against his fourteen, even the stubborn
Saxon must see that he was outnumbered.  An
instant later the American felt dismay tugging at
his heart.
</p>

<p>
For Sara Helmuth came in alone, with neither
Afghan nor Arab behind her, but with an <i>askaris</i>
and a seaman conducting her.  With a glance at
Hammer and Solomon she walked up to Krausz,
who doffed his sun-helmet for a wonder, and opened
fire.
</p>

<p>
"What does this mean, doctor?  Are my friends
your prisoners?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, dear lady," he beamed, putting
forward a camp-chair, which she ignored.  "Thiss
Mr. Hammer iss a murderer, and later on Adolf
takes him back to justice, yess!  Thiss Mr. Solomon
is an impudent little fat man, who gets turned out
in the jungle to starve&mdash;but away from hiss men,
yess, away from hiss men.  Not on the seaward side,
you understand!"
</p>

<p>
He smirked knowingly, and the anger in the
girl flashed out.
</p>

<p>
"You scoundrel!  For a man of your position
to stoop so low as to steal and lie!  Oh, I know
the whole story now!  You stole those papers
from my father, your friend, as he was dying;
but you didn't steal them all, Dr. Sigurd Krausz!
Poor fool of a thief that you are, not even to know
a fort from a slave barracoon&mdash;and yet you call
yourself an archaeologist!  Why, you don't even
know what the treasure is yet, the best part of it, nor
where it is, nor where the real fort is!  And you
never will know.  Now, either send Mr. Hammer
and Mr. Solomon safely out with me, or I'll&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Beggin' your pardon, miss, but if so be as I
could smoke it'd be a mortal help!"
</p>

<p>
The words were a desperate effort on the part of
Solomon to save the situation.  So rapidly had the
furious girl poured out her denunciation that before
Hammer realized what she was saying, before any
one could intervene, she had given away the
secret.
</p>

<p>
Solomon's words, however, and the look that he
flashed her, saved her from letting Krausz know
any more.  It was all-important that he should not
know that they had men in the jungle ready to
spring at his throat.
</p>

<p>
As she realized what she had said she went deadly
pale; but there was no wavering in her eyes, and
Hammer, dismayed though he was, could not but
approve her for it.  Krausz, too, caught the meaning
of her words, but more slowly.
</p>

<p>
As he grasped their import his face changed from
red to white, and a snarl came into his eyes; then
he sank into his camp-chair, gazing steadily at her
as he forced himself into control and tried to read
meaning into her words.
</p>

<p>
"You know the whole story now&mdash;so!  And
they were not all stolen, yess?  But what iss
thiss&mdash;that I do not know a fort from a slave
barracoon&mdash;<i>Himmel</i>! That iss why we found nothing!  And,
<i>fräulein</i>, you know all these things, yess?"
</p>

<p>
"I do, and you shall not know them."
</p>

<p>
"Listen, <i>fräulein</i>!"  He leaned forward, sweat
dripping from his face, and earnestness in every
feature, while the ribbon of muscle on his brow
pounded furiously.
</p>

<p>
"You know thiss, and I do not, <i>hein</i>?  What will
you take that you shall tell me?  It iss nothing to
you, it iss everything to me!"
</p>

<p>
"Tell you?"  And the scorn in her voice lashed
him like a whip.  "Thief and liar that you are!
Tell you?  I would sooner tell that man Jenson
there than you!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yess!  Jenson!"  Still he gazed at her,
fighting himself hard.  "I have made a mistake,
then?  Thiss iss not the fort, but I knew that much
already, <i>fräulein</i>!  And this Mr. Hammer iss your
friend&mdash;<i>Ach, mein Gott</i>!  It wass you who told about
the papers, Jenson!"
</p>

<p>
The big Saxon whirled in his chair, his hand
shot out, and Jenson, clutched by the shoulder,
was dragged bodily over the table into the group.
The fellow was too frightened even to whimper,
and the blaze in the eyes of Krausz seemed to
paralyse him.
</p>

<p>
"So, it wass you who told, while you were
away!  You told, swine!  Listen, <i>fräulein</i>!  Tell
me what you know, and we shall be partners,
yess!  Tell me, and this Mr. Hammer he shall
take Adolf with him!  Perhaps it wass Adolf who
killed Captain Harcourt, after&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Quick as Jenson was, the scientist was quicker,
his foot shooting out with the swiftness of light.
Hammer fancied that Jenson's wrist was broken
by the kick, for he screamed once, horribly, even
before the knife fell to the ground.  Krausz flung
him to the seamen with an order in German, and a
moment later Hammer was seized and his hands
bound before he could resist.
</p>

<p>
The incident aroused all the brute in Krausz
and he stood glaring around for a moment, Sara
Helmuth instinctively shrinking before him.
</p>

<p>
"You, <i>fräulein</i>, you know me!  Yess, the
papers were stolen, but I did not come to the right
place?  Then you shall tell me where that place
it iss.
</p>

<p>
"I will not," came her firm answer.
</p>

<p>
Krausz turned and snapped out an order in
German, pointing to Hammer.  The American
saw one of the sailors snatch the rhinoceros-hide
whip from the <i>askari</i>, but the girl's face had
gone white.
</p>

<p>
"Stop!" she almost screamed.  "I'll tell&mdash;I'll
take you there; but not that!"
</p>

<p>
"Good," grunted the Saxon, watching her
malevolently.  Jenson, bound and writhing
impotently, was laid on the ground, and he took
the whip from the seaman.
</p>

<p>
"Get up, Jenson."  A stroke of the whip and
Jenson rose; what with the whip and his arm,
the man was in agony, and Hammer almost pitied
him.
</p>

<p>
A few orders from Krausz, and Solomon was
bidden go where he willed&mdash;on the landward side
of camp; two <i>askaris</i> forced Jenson and Hammer
along, two more followed, and with Krausz and
Sara Helmuth walking side by side the party
proceeded up the hill toward the jungle and the
ruins beyond, while John Solomon looked after
them for an instant and then incontinently took
to his heels.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br /><br />
THE PLACE OF SKULLS
</h3>

<p>
Cyrus Hammer, as he was forced along beside
Jenson, was aware that the crisis had come in
the twinkling of an eye and that he had proven
wanting.  Sara Helmuth had met it in his
place&mdash;and Krausz had proven victor.
</p>

<p>
On the surface, at least.  But, as he heard
Sara Helmuth telling the scientist the tale of the
real fort, Hammer smiled to himself.  She might
reveal the secret of the fort and treasure and all
else&mdash;for Krausz had done the very thing which
Hammer had never for an instant dreamed that
he would do in releasing John Solomon.
</p>

<p>
The American recollected that, to Krausz,
Solomon was no more than a mere pudgy little
man who had shoved himself into the affairs of
others, and for whom a day of wandering in the
jungle would be veritable torture.
</p>

<p>
Krausz had woven his own net, for the only
man there able to warn him against Solomon was
Jenson, and from Jenson he would receive no
warning.  Moreover, Hammer saw that vengeance
was like to be taken from his hands, since Jenson's
punishment was slowly but surely drawing in upon
him.
</p>

<p>
His exultation did not last long, however.  He
soon saw that, short of a murderous volley which
would cut down all four <i>askaris</i> and Krausz with
them, Solomon could not do much to help them
just at present.
</p>

<p>
The girl was telling Krausz of the treasure now
as they stood among the trenches on the hill,
where tools lay flung about as the natives had
deserted them.
</p>

<p>
Krausz had done a good deal, thought Hammer;
in that week he had found out for himself that
he was on a false scent&mdash;and that despite Solomon's
prediction to the contrary.
</p>

<p>
Behind them the camp lay quiet, smoke curling
up from the fires, the seamen and the four remaining
<i>askaris</i> looking after the party.  In front stretched
the jungle, deep green and yellow tangles of vines
and trees and bamboos.  The girl turned to
Hammer.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know just how to get in there,
Hammer?" she said wearily.  "I've promised to
guide the doctor there, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He saw that she was trying not to betray the
secret of the camp from which she had come, but
with Solomon gone to his men, as he plainly was,
there was naught to be feared.
</p>

<p>
"Lead us by the path you came," he reassured
her, Krausz paying no heed, but searching the
jungle with eager eyes.  "The ruins ought to be
straight back from these, about two hundred yards
or so."
</p>

<p>
She caught the meaning of his words and his
quick smile and, with an answering flash in her eyes,
turned back to Krausz, who still bore the whip
taken from the <i>askari</i>.  Though he carried no
gun, Hammer caught a bulge in the coat-pocket
of the big Saxon and knew that he was not unarmed.
</p>

<p>
Now, without further hesitation, Sara Helmuth
led the way across the half-trenched lines of ruins.
The American saw that when she had come to
the camp that morning out of the jungle-hid fort
it had been with little fear of such a result as
this.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps trusting in John Solomon or himself,
perhaps determined, if necessary, to force the
doctor's hand by threat of exposure&mdash;any one of
a hundred reasons flashed through Hammer's
mind; but the central thought was that she had
borne herself far better than had he.
</p>

<p>
Bound, helpless, marched at the side of the
staggering, moaning Jenson, he found himself
forced into a narrow path, and the jungle closed
around them.
</p>

<p>
Krausz was not careless, however.  Finding
that the path was actually walled in by trees,
bamboos, and creepers, and doubtless suspicious
at seeing it recently cleared, he sent an <i>askari</i>
ahead, then Sara Helmuth, and followed himself,
with another <i>askari</i> behind, his long whip ready
for action, and ordered Hammer and his guard
immediately behind, while Jenson and the fourth
Masai brought up the rear.
</p>

<p>
Barely had they got well in shelter of the jungle
than Hammer, with Jenson's moans coming from
behind like the inarticulate cries of a trapped
beast, felt the hand of his guard fumbling with
the cords that bound his wrists.
</p>

<p>
He half-turned in surprise, when a hand on
his shoulder pressed him about again; with the
fingers of his other hand the Masai tapped gently
on the little silver ring Hammer still wore, and
the latter understood.
</p>

<p>
This Masai fighting man, brought by Jenson
from Zanzibar to defend Krausz, with the German
eagle on tunic and fez, had recognized the sign
of John Solomon, and had made answer to it!
</p>

<p>
Almost as the unbelievable thought found its
way into his brain he felt that his bonds were
loosened; a warning hand pressed his wrist again,
and was gone.  He comprehended that for the
present he was not to free himself, and though
the impulse was in him to leap on Krausz from
behind, he held it in check and followed blindly.
</p>

<p>
In one respect at least the scientist seemed
sincere, and that was in his belief, inspired by
Jenson, that Hammer had stabbed Harcourt.
Indeed, in matters foreign to his calling Krausz
was probably all that could be wished.
</p>

<p>
But he, too, beginning at the comparatively
innocuous point of taking the papers belonging
to the dying Helmuth, had been wound in the
skein of cumulative wrong-doing, reflected
Hammer.  He was not weak like Jenson, however;
his wrong-doing was aggressive, determined, positive,
while that of Jenson was decidedly negative.
</p>

<p>
Where the hiding-place of the relics and papers
was the American himself did not know, though
Solomon and the girl did.  Now Krausz knew
as well, or soon would, for Hammer divined Sara's
intention perfectly.
</p>

<p>
She would give up all in order to appease the
Saxon, depending on Solomon to eventually overpower
the latter, if he did not first prevent the
disclosure of the secret.
</p>

<p>
Hammer spared no thought on himself.  That
he was in any present danger did not occur to
him, since he could not suspect the thoughts
behind the doctor's heavy-lidded eyes and throbbing
band of muscle.
</p>

<p>
For the jungle smell had entered into the nostrils
of the scientist&mdash;and whether it be in jungle or
forest or sand reaches, no man can taste the
loneliness of Nature and hold to his veneer of
man-learning.
</p>

<p>
It is the same whether he be beside the Mackenzie
or the Mahakkam, under Kilimanjaro or Tacoma.
Once away from his kind, man forgets his kind,
for the despotism of the wild overbears all else.
</p>

<p>
It was so with Krausz and, to a certain sense,
with Sara Helmuth; it was so with Hammer,
though he did not comprehend it; but if it was
so with John Solomon no man could say.
</p>

<p>
"We are here," exclaimed the girl dully.
</p>

<p>
The party halted.  Without perceiving it in
the half-gloom of the overhanging masses of
vegetation, they had suddenly come among half-fallen
walls, ruined stone structures that loomed far
up and were held in place by thigh-thick vines.
</p>

<p>
Through some had pierced old trees and limbs
of trees, yet the walls still held in grotesque
mimicry; no roofs were there, but only walls and
ruins of walls.  And over the place brooded silence,
with never a chattering of monkey or parrot's
screech to quiver hollowly up.
</p>

<p>
Hammer felt a twitch at his arm, but shook
off the hand of the <i>askari</i>.  If the man thought
he was going to run for it and leave Sara Helmuth
in the lurch, he was much mistaken.  Slowly,
very slowly, the American saw that men had been
here not long before, since in amid the ruins were
evidences of clearing&mdash;lopped branches piled up
in places, flickering shadow-gleams of sunlight
that filtered down from somewhere above, and
queer white fragments that strewed the ground
in spots.
</p>

<p>
If Krausz saw this, however, he paid small
heed, but clambered over a smoothed-out pile
of stones, the others following.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Gott</i>!  Truly thiss iss the real place!"
</p>

<p>
He stood looking around, caressing the handle
of the whip with his fingers.  On three sides
towered walls and trees and vines, inextricable
and undefined; where walls ended and trees began
it was impossible to say, for the growth of two
hundred jungle years is not to be lightly set aside
by a few Arabs in a week's time.  Jenson sank
down where he stood, cowed into silence by the
silence around.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, as if the echoes of the doctor's words
had worked through the interstices of the leafy roof,
a great burst of shrill chattering arose somewhere
overhead.
</p>

<p>
Hammer jumped, startled; at the same instant
two or three white objects shot down from nowhere,
apparently.  Two burst into shreds, the other
struck a mossy wall and rebounded to the feet
of Krausz, who leaped back in alarm.
</p>

<p>
One half-stifled shriek burst from the first
<i>askari</i> and stilled the clamour above.  Sara Helmuth
stared at the thing, as did everyone else, her face
very pale; and Hammer knew, at last, that Omar
ibn Kasim had spoken truth indeed&mdash;for the object
was a skull.
</p>

<p>
An oath from Krausz recalled the frightened
<i>askaris</i> to their vigilance.  He stood mopping
his brow and staring from the unbroken skull
to the trees above, and, as Hammer glanced up,
he saw one or two dark forms flitting about the
top of the nearest wall and vanishing in the trees.
</p>

<p>
"Monkeys!" exclaimed Sara Helmuth, her eyes
unnaturally large, but her voice firm.  "Are you
afraid of monkeys and skulls, Herr Doctor?"
</p>

<p>
For answer Krausz snorted and picked up the
skull.  He flung it away instantly.
</p>

<p>
"Pah!  It iss mouldy&mdash;it hass been the ground
in.  Monkeys&mdash;pigs of scavengers!  Yess, thiss iss
the place."
</p>

<p>
For a moment he stood silent.  Then, for the
gruesome thing must have wakened the depths of
him, he swiftly changed the whip to his left hand,
drew a revolver with the other, and turned on
the group behind him.
</p>

<p>
Hammer started at the change in the man.
His great brow was mottled, as were his cheeks,
save for the panting band of muscle that stood
out deep red, and his black eyes gleamed with
something that was near akin to ferocity.  Never
had Hammer seen such a face on a man, and now,
for the first time, a strange alarm stirred within
him.
</p>

<p>
Krausz tried to speak, but could not for a
moment; lips and tongue were dry, and his voice
came in a hoarse growl that betrayed how that
monkey-flung skull had got on his nerves.
</p>

<p>
"You tricked me, yess!" he cried at length.
"You tricked me, Sigurd Krausz!  You, <i>fräulein</i>,
you, and Adolf here!  But no more shall you
trick me, no.  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused quickly, plainly fighting for his lost
self-control, meeting the firm eyes of Sara Helmuth.
Hammer, fearing that the man would break out
into violence, tensed his muscles and measured
the distance between them, but Krausz lowered
his revolver as slow sanity crept back into his
eyes.
</p>

<p>
The girl still faced him, though she had shrunk
back before that mad outburst, and in reply her
voice came low, but with a note that seemed to
calm his rage, so cold and self-contained was it.
Hammer noted that she made no gesture as for a
weapon; she must have come unarmed, probably
on the impulse of the moment.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you were tricked, Her Doctor&mdash;tricked
by a girl.  And you are called the greatest
archaeologist in Europe!  Dresden will laugh when it
hears the story, doctor&mdash;the story of how you dug
for a week in the ruins of a storehouse, while
the fort you were in search of lay under your nose
here.  And then the treasure!
</p>

<p>
"Now free me and Mr. Hammer there, and I
promise you that this shall never be known in
Europe, Dr. Krausz.  If the story came out it
would blast your reputation, and you know it
well."
</p>

<p>
Krausz looked at her, frowning as if in hard
thought.  Hammer saw that the strain was telling
heavily upon her, and breathed a sigh of relief
when the scientist replied:
</p>

<p>
"Yess, it would my reputation blast, <i>fräulein</i>.
That iss very right&mdash;very.  But listen.  You have
told me that the treasure was in two parts, yess,
and the relics and papers, I do not know where
they are.  But you know, <i>fräulein</i>.  Now tell
me, take me to thiss place also, then will I free
you and Mr. Hammer and Adolf&mdash;yess, you shall
go free with Adolf, both of you!"
</p>

<p>
As he made this offer, there was something
about the narrowed eyes of the man that Hammer
did not like.  Sara Helmuth studied him for a
moment, but she was plainly weakening fast.
</p>

<p>
Something of the fetid aspect of the place seemed
to be in the face of Krausz, and she palpably
distrusted him; but he forced quietude into his
features and stared stolidly at her, waiting.
</p>

<p>
Another white object fluttered down from above
with a chattering that floated away amid the
tree-tops, and the girl shuddered as the skull
struck the wall behind her and shivered rottenly.
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;how if I refuse?"
</p>

<p>
"If you refuse, <i>fräulein</i>, the whip&mdash;and no
promise."
</p>

<p>
He gestured with his hand toward Hammer.
The girl flung the latter one helpless glance, and
bowed her head as she turned.
</p>

<p>
"Come."
</p>

<p>
Krausz, with triumph beaming from his massive
features, motioned the others to fall in line, and
they went as at first, out across the fallen wall.
To the American the place was shapeless, formless,
but Krausz cast quick nodding glances about him,
and Sara Helmuth did not hesitate.
</p>

<p>
Hammer felt his heart throbbing&mdash;the atmosphere
of the jungle-hid ruins was oppressive, stultifying.
The girl led them across fallen walls and past
cleared spaces to a great heap of ruins overgrown
thickly.
</p>

<p>
Through it led a hard-beaten path, and with
half-darkness about them she paused at what seemed
to be a square hole in the ground, perhaps a dozen
feet across, with trees roofing all in overhead.
Here the path ended.
</p>

<p>
"It is there," she said simply.
</p>

<p>
Krausz growled something at the <i>askaris</i>, and
went forward.  Hammer, watching, saw him stop
suddenly as though listening.  Then, at the edge
of the hole, he laid down revolver and whip and
went to his knees, and so flat on his belly, his hands
gripping roots on either side of him.
</p>

<p>
Here he stayed motionless for what seemed ages
to the overwrought American.  When, at last,
he crawled upright, his hands were shaking tremulously,
his face was ghastly white, and he clutched
at a near-by tree for support.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mein Gott</i>!" he said thickly, staring at the
girl.  "<i>Mein Gott</i>!  <i>Mein Gott</i>!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br /><br />
THE PIT OF ADDERS
</h3>

<p>
Hammer could not understand himself.  He
was practically free, he realized fully that this
was the time to act, when Krausz was unarmed,
and yet his brain was dulled and refused to impart
movement to his limbs.  He stared at Krausz,
fascinated by the least movement of the man,
utterly unable to do a thing.
</p>

<p>
Whether it was auto-hypnotism, or whether the
terrible deadening influence that had come upon
him was caused by the noxious jungle bringing
back his fever, the American never knew.
</p>

<p>
Jenson had ceased to moan, and crouched at
one side by his guard, cowed.  The Masai cast
uneasy glances about and at each other, but still
Krausz stared at Sara Helmuth, who seemed to
droop under his gaze.
</p>

<p>
"You knew, yess?" he muttered finally.
</p>

<p>
She nodded listlessly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I stayed near here last night.  I was here."
</p>

<p>
The colour flowed back into the face of the
scientist little by little.  Turning his back on
the party, he stooped and picked up revolver and
whip, then stood looking down at that which lay
in the blackness of the hole.
</p>

<p>
Hammer wanted to scream, but he could not,
for some unseen power had paralysed his muscles.
He wondered, idly, what lay in that hole, but he
was more interested in watching the big Saxon.
He had never seen Krausz so completely overcome
before, he thought, and it made him want
to laugh.
</p>

<p>
"By Godfrey!"  He shook himself, conquering
that terrible apathy.  "You've got to quit this,
old man, or God knows what'll happen.  That
chap is breeding trouble and first thing you know
he'll spring something bad."
</p>

<p>
Why the thought came to him he could not
tell, but come it did.  Krausz turned, with a
nervous glance around at the silent trees, but
there was no danger in his face, save that the
tell-tale ribbon of muscle was pounding madly.
</p>

<p>
Then once more the scientist went to the brink
of the hole and looked down.  It was as if he were
reflecting on something, weighing something over
in his mind before coming to a decision.
</p>

<p>
A half-sound caught Hammer's attention and he
looked at Sara Helmuth.  She had turned partly
aside, her head was down in her two hands, and
her shoulders were shaking softly as she stood.
Overcome by the horror of the place, she had given
way at last, and the sight was too much for Hammer.
</p>

<p>
As if by magic he felt himself once more, with
all his old quickness of thought and vigour of
action returned to him.  Solomon had failed them
and they were alone, and the thought brought
responsibility back to him.
</p>

<p>
Quietly slipping his hands free of the loosened
cords, he strode over to the girl's side, none
hindering him, and in the face of the jungle horror
about them he put an arm about her shoulders,
drawing her head to his breast.
</p>

<p>
"Quiet, Sara," and he patted her back in a
clumsy effort to soothe her.  "It's all right,
girl&mdash;don't cry.  We'll get out of this place and
forget about it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
For several weeks now Sara Helmuth had forced
herself into the position of a man among men,
playing a lone hand in the dark, and while
friendship had come to her in the guise of Solomon
and Hammer, her woman's soul had craved
sympathy as a child craves its mother's arms.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the place in which they stood
mirrored dread into her soul, for only the evening
before she had stood at the edge of that hole and
gazed down while the Arabs held torches aloft
and looked grimly at each other.  So, but chiefly
because of Hammer's actions and words, she
smiled once and fainted.
</p>

<p>
The American felt frightened for a moment,
then relief came to him.  The burden had been
put on his shoulders, and, allowing the girl to
slip to the ground, he turned to find Krausz looking
at them and frowning, blackness brooding in
his eyes and an evil twist to his heavy jaw.
</p>

<p>
"She hass fainted?  That iss good."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she's fainted: but you'll notice that
she kept her word first."  Hammer's anger turned
cold within him, for as he wondered what frightful
thing lay in that hole he remembered the story of
the pit of snakes&mdash;and he dreaded snakes as he
dreaded no other thing on earth.
</p>

<p>
"She's kept her word, Krausz, so I guess it's
up to you to keep yours.  You lend me a couple
of these <i>askaris</i> to carry Miss Helmuth and we'll
be going."
</p>

<p>
"Wait."
</p>

<p>
The scientist seemed oddly apprehensive, seemed
as if he were trying to say something which could
not find utterance.  He looked at Hammer, then
at the <i>askaris</i>, then at the jungle above and around,
and finally beckoned.
</p>

<p>
"Come&mdash;look at thiss thing."
</p>

<p>
Hammer did not want to look, yet it seemed
as though some force drew him to follow the other
to the edge of that black hole.  Now he knew
why the horror had come upon him, the snake-fear
which lies at the bottom of many men's souls
and which is not to be explained or reasoned
away.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mein Gott</i>&mdash;look at them!"
</p>

<p>
The American obeyed with cold chills gripping
his spine.  Yet he could see little.  The pit was
deep, very deep.  As his eyes searched the darkness
of it he guessed that the bottom was twenty feet
away.
</p>

<p>
Then a soft, slithering sound broke the dead
stillness, and a low "his-s-s" which there was no
mistaking.
</p>

<p>
"Adders," stated the doctor decidedly.  "Puff-adders,
my friend, and a bite it iss death, yess!"
</p>

<p>
Hammer did not know a puff-adder from a
black snake, but he did know why the other had
gazed so long into that pit of darkness, for there
was a deadly fascination about it that compelled
his eyes despite his loathing.
</p>

<p>
"If the treasure iss there, it can wait, yess!"
exclaimed the scientist.
</p>

<p>
The American mentally added that it could
wait until what Sherman said war was froze over,
for all of him; but he still looked down until
gradually the thing took shape before him.
</p>

<p>
The sides of the pit were straight and well
paved, slimy, mossy, with never a break in the
stones.  Far down something scintillated for an
instant, then again, and the slithering noise went
rustling faintly without cessation.  Hammer was
aware that Krausz had come to his side and was
pointing down.
</p>

<p>
"There&mdash;look at that.  It iss a platform, no?"
</p>

<p>
With the words the scientist scraped a match
and flung it down.  The American got a glimpse
of a small jutting-out stone, some two feet square,
half-way down the pit, and below that a twining,
shuddering mass of something that drove him
reeling back with sickness strong upon him.
</p>

<p>
"That's enough," he gasped, wiping the cold
sweat from his face.  "I'll get out of here and
stay gone, don't worry&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Stop!"
</p>

<p>
There was a new note in the voice of Krausz,
and it brought Hammer around instantly.  The
other had followed him back from the hole, and
was glaring at him with such mad eyes that
instinctively the American took a step backward.
</p>

<p>
"You are not going away," said the big Saxon
slowly, his eyes burning into those of Hammer.
The band of muscle was deep crimson, and it was
pulsating like a wild thing against the man's
white brow.  Hammer's foot struck against the
limp form of Sara Helmuth, and the touch restored
him from his panic.
</p>

<p>
"Eh?  What's that?" he exclaimed, unbelieving.
</p>

<p>
"I say you are not going away&mdash;you and Adolf
and Professor Helmuth, yess!"
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with you?" demanded
Hammer, thoroughly angry.  "You promised that
when&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yess, and my promise I shall keep&mdash;but thiss
way."  Krausz gestured with his whip toward
the hole.  "I promised to set you free, <i>nein</i>?"
</p>

<p>
Between anger at the man and fear of what lay
behind him, Hammer stared at him astounded.
It had not occurred to him that Krausz would
not perform his part of the agreement&mdash;but what
did he mean by "thiss way"?
</p>

<p>
The big Saxon went on, his jaw pushed forward
aggressively, his eyes fastened banefully on
Hammer:
</p>

<p>
"Fools!  Did you think that I would let you
go, yess, to make of me a joke before all Europe?
<i>Ach</i>, no!  Am I, Sigurd Krausz, to be tricked
and made a fool?"
</p>

<p>
He turned swiftly to the nearest <i>askari</i>&mdash;the
same who had freed Hammer.
</p>

<p>
"Go back to the camp and bring a rope&mdash;quick,
you black swine!"
</p>

<p>
The man saluted, flung Hammer a helpless
look, and disappeared.  The other three watched,
leaning on their rifles.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" began the American,
aghast before the terrible thought that had leaped
into his brain.  Krausz flung about on him,
raging.
</p>

<p>
"Mean?  What do I mean?  American pig!
Iss my work to be spoiled by thiss <i>fräulein</i>?  No!
<i>Ach</i>, but Adolf iss a devil!  He betrays everyone,
but he shall not betray Sigurd Krausz.  No, nor
you, American.  I meant to kill you all, but now
I have a better way, yess, and I shall my promise
keep.  Later I will come back, yess, and get the
treasure and give it to the world&mdash;my treasure,
my papers, my relics!
</p>

<p>
"Never hass so great a chance come&mdash;and it
iss not to be perilled by you.  So I tell you plainly,
American, you shall not play with Sigurd Krausz."
</p>

<p>
Then, too late, Hammer realized that the look
in the other's eyes was little short of madness.
He cast a look around, but the jungle hedged
them in, silent and merciless, with no sign of
Solomon or aid.
</p>

<p>
But&mdash;what did the madman mean to do?  He
was crazed on the subject of his work, that was
plain, and whether the jungle mania had
unbalanced him or not, there was a fury in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" asked Hammer again.
"Don't think you can get away with any dirty
work, Krausz, or Solomon&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Bah!  Do not joke with me.  Listen&mdash;you saw
that platform, American?  Then I tell you that
you and Adolf Jenson and Professor Helmuth,
you shall stand there until you get tired.  You
shall be free, yess&mdash;but you cannot get up, and
when you go down you will not play with Sigurd
Krausz any&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Hammer saw red and struck.  The whole insane
scheme darted clear to his mind, and he drove
his fist home into that mocking face with a furious
curse.  Krausz flung up his revolver-hand, but
Hammer dashed it aside and the weapon fell;
he saw Krausz reel back and knew he had crushed
the man's nose with his first blow, but he followed
with relentless fury in his heart.
</p>

<p>
Krausz tried to fight him off, and he saw the
three <i>askaris</i> closing in on him; then he felt the
whip curl about him, sending a terrible red wale
over his cheek and biting into his body; but time
and again those fists which had won him his name
stabbed into the face of the big Saxon&mdash;until the
<i>askaris</i> ground him to the earth by main weight
and tied him.
</p>

<p>
The American glared up, still raging in his
helplessness.  Krausz had dropped his whip and
was clinging to a long vine that trailed down
across the body of Jenson, who had not moved.
</p>

<p>
The fight had hardly lasted a minute, but
Hammer had learned his trade in a hard school.
The heavy features of Krausz were crushed into
a red mass, for the first blow of Hammer's had
splintered his nose; yet, for all the pain he must
have been suffering, Krausz said no word.
</p>

<p>
Groping for his handkerchief, he slowly wiped
the blood from his eyes, then stooped and picked
up his pith helmet and put it on, carefully letting
down the mosquito-gauze about his features.
</p>

<p>
There was something in the action, something
of iron tenacity, that made Hammer hold his
breath, waiting for he knew not what.  With that
crimsoned visage masked from sight, Sigurd Krausz
appeared even more formidable.  Hammer knew
that his outburst had effected nothing.
</p>

<p>
Yet it had been half panic.  The scientist's
fiendish plan had sent a shudder of abhorrence
through him; the very odour of that pit nauseated
him, and he had lashed out in a frenzy of mingled
fear and rage.  Then the memory of that narrow
shelf of rock&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"By Godfrey!" thought the American desperately,
"if Solomon doesn't show up in a hurry it's
all off!  That ledge won't hold more than one
person, that's sure."
</p>

<p>
Panic-stricken, he watched the Saxon.  Krausz
took a step, and stumbled across Jenson, all but
falling.  At the same moment the <i>askari</i> who had
been sent to camp returned, panting, carrying a
length of rope.
</p>

<p>
Krausz seized it from him and bent the end
around under Jenson's arms.  From where he
stood Hammer could see how the secretary trembled,
and a moment later he shrank away from Krausz,
scrambling desperately to regain his feet, screaming.
</p>

<p>
"Don't!"  The wail shrilled up.  "Don't!
Oh&mdash;God&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Krausz had signalled to the <i>askaris</i>, who shut
off Jenson's screams with grins of delight.  It
was not the sort of work they usually did for white
people, but to Masai hearts it was glorious.  Hammer
realized that the one friendly man could do nothing
for him, and his cheeks blanched.
</p>

<p>
He watched Jenson carried to the edge of the
pit and carefully lowered.  A jerk or two freed
the rope, and since no sound came forth, Hammer
supposed that the man had reached the ledge
in safety.  Krausz turned to where Sara Helmuth
lay, still senseless.
</p>

<p>
Then the American knew that there was no
hope, that this fiend would actually carry out
his threat, and he felt his flesh creep at the thought.
</p>

<p>
He pictured to himself that narrow ledge, with
Jenson already there&mdash;ready to fight off whomever
came next.
</p>

<p>
If the girl was sent down alone, unconscious
as she was, what little chance she had would be
gone, while he, Hammer, was whimpering up here!
</p>

<p>
He slowly got to his feet, the <i>askari</i> who stood
over him pulling him up, and, as Krausz leaned
over the girl with the rope ready, Hammer knew
that he had become himself once more.  He might
die, but he would die like a man.
</p>

<p>
"Put that rope around me, Krausz," he said
calmly.  "I'll take her in my arms, if you'll
untie my wrists."
</p>

<p>
The other straightened up, turning toward him,
and Hammer saw the little dribble of blood that
trickled down the front of his khaki coat from
beneath the helmet-gauze.  He noted, too, that
Krausz feared to trust him, and added desperately:
</p>

<p>
"I'll give you my word, doctor, to make no
trouble.  Let's have it over with decency."
</p>

<p>
"Good!" came the rumbling response, with a
gesture to one of the Masai.  The latter cut
Hammer's bonds, and the American strode to the
side of Sara, lifting her in his arms.  Then, with
firm step but ghastly face, for the feeling of
revulsion was almost too strong to be endured, he walked
to the brink of the pit, and waited.
</p>

<p>
"Hurry, for God's sake!" he gasped.
</p>

<p>
The rope was put around him, under his
shoulders; he did not feel how it cut into him as
his weight came upon it.  He knew only that
terrible darkness was rising up at him, that the
nightmare had begun, that slimy mossy stones
were all about him.
</p>

<p>
He strove for a footing with his hanging feet,
but to no avail.  The walls were smooth, fissureless;
he could not look down because of the body
of the girl who lay in his arms.  And it was as
well that he could not, for an instant later his
foot struck something soft.
</p>

<p>
He almost screamed at the touch, having
forgotten Jenson for a moment; then he remembered.
What next happened he could not tell; he felt
himself swinging on the rope, and a great fear
surged into him that the Masai had dropped him.
</p>

<p>
Then he knew that Jenson was beating against
his legs, trying to drive him off with his
beast-like, wordless whimpers.
</p>

<p>
He felt that he was kicking out in desperation,
and his foot landed once; then from below came
a single strangled cry, followed by a soft thud,
and an instant later he was afoot on the rock
ledge.
</p>

<p>
How long he stood there holding Sara Helmuth
he never knew, for he was battling with all his
will-power to get control of the awful horror that
was over him.  The snake-fear had gripped him,
and the very rock at his back seemed to be a living
thing that was pressing him forward, trying to
fling him to the things below.  This must have
been the rope loosening from him, however, for
presently he had conquered himself and the rope
was gone from about him.
</p>

<p>
For a little space he did not realize that he was
in any great danger.  He was a good ten feet
above the things that crawled down there and as
much below the surface; he thought of Jenson,
but spared no pity on the man; and the remembrance
of his own words regarding the snake-pit and Jenson
even brought the faintest flicker of a smile to his
tense lips.  Yet in his bitterest moments he could
not have wished the man such agony as was now
his own.
</p>

<p>
He listened for some sound from above, but
none came.  Had Krausz departed to cure his
own hurts or was he waiting for some word from
his victims?  Hammer compressed his lips tighter;
at least, the Saxon would not have the satisfaction
of hearing him whimper, he thought.  He was
thankful that the girl showed no signs of wakening
from her swoon.
</p>

<p>
But how was Solomon to know where they were?
He could not have been watching, or he would
have prevented the terrible deed at all costs; of
that Hammer was assured.
</p>

<p>
If he did not shout for aid&mdash;but what good would
shouting do him?  The sound would be lost in
the pit or in the leafy roof above; he could not
have pierced that mass of vegetation if he had had
the lungs of Stentor.
</p>

<p>
It occurred to him that if he set the girl down
on the ledge at his feet he might be able to get
out in some way.  There was only a ten-foot
wall above him, and even the mosses would give
him foothold.
</p>

<p>
Besides, her weight was beginning to tell on
his arms, and he could not hold her for ever.  He
felt gingerly forward with one foot&mdash;and cold fear
struck him to the heart.
</p>

<p>
Now he knew why Jenson had slipped away,
and how.  In the darkness of the pit, looking
down from above, the ledge had seemed fairly
wide; as a matter of fact, it jutted straight out
from the wall for a scant foot; then the upper
part of the stone broke and shelved down on all
sides to the under part.
</p>

<p>
On that foot square of rock it was possible for
one person to stand; it was possible for him to
stand so long as he could hold the girl's weight
in his arms, but there was not foothold for two
persons&mdash;and he could not hold Sara Helmuth
much longer.  As it was, his arms were tiring
rapidly.
</p>

<p>
Hammer's face clenched into a grimace of pure
agony as the tremendous temptation swept over
him&mdash;all the more powerful because of his inborn
dread of what lay below.  The girl was unconscious;
she would never know!  Was it not more
merciful, after all, to give her to death now than
to leave her precariously hanging on that
foot-square ledge until she wakened, moved,
and&mdash;dropped?
</p>

<p>
"Oh, God!" he muttered, Jenson's cry on his
lips, and repeated it over and over.  How could
he save his own worthless life at the expense of
hers?  A terrible convulsion seized him; he
tottered, and only recovered his balance by a
miracle.  The danger sickened him, but it also
woke latent words in his brain.
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;I think it will be one of power, not of failure.
I would like to be there&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He groaned, and it was as if the groan had been
wrenched out of his soul, for he knew that his
great moment had arrived.  And he knew that,
despite himself, it would be one of power&mdash;nay it
was one of power!
</p>

<p>
Though half of his soul fought against the other
half, trying to loose his arms, it was in vain;
sophistry was swept aside, and he felt that he
must do his utmost, even though it might be
useless.  He would go to join Jenson, and he must
go soon, lest his strength fail.
</p>

<p>
Feeling about with his feet, he found the last
inch of rock that would hold him up, and slowly
bent downward.  Twice he had to shift his position
laboriously because of the wall behind him; once
again he tottered, his foot slipped, and only a
desperate effort recovered him.
</p>

<p>
After he had laid the girl across that ledge he
could never get upright again without standing
on her body&mdash;and, harmless though that might
have been to her, it never came into his head.
</p>

<p>
He lowered her to his knees, twisting about,
and inch by inch bent downward until she lay
across his feet and ankles in safety.  Only his
grip on her body held him on the ledge now, and
the physical torture of his position sent the sweat
running down his face in streams.
</p>

<p>
His will-power all but failed him in that last
instant.  With infinite pains he drew one foot
free, then the other, and went to his knees.  But
they slipped on the slant of broken rock-face&mdash;and,
bending swiftly, he touched his lips to hers
as he went down.
</p>

<p>
He seemed to fall for miles and miles through
space.  From somewhere above came a dull report,
and a second; then a shock, and he landed feet
first on something soft, and felt great shapes
twining around him.  He screamed&mdash;and fell
asleep.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><br />
"THAHABU!"
</h3>

<p>
"I did, miss."
</p>

<p>
Who did what?  Dull mutters and echoings
pierced into Hammer's brain, as if voices that he
used to know were whispering in the distance.
They swelled and died away and swelled again,
reminding him vaguely of the bells he had heard
one evening in Venice.
</p>

<p>
There it was again&mdash;there&mdash;that was the clear
silver of San Giorgio's Campanile, with the deeper
tones of Giovanni e Paolo dipping down through
the silver, then Santa Maria Formosa dropped in
her liquid notes, with, over all, far-flung cadences
drifting faintly down on the sea-wind from the
Frari until the great dome of the Salute spoke
to the sunset, and all the myriad others&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
No, it was nothing but Harcourt talking, talking
to his mother!  That was odd: Harcourt was five
miles out at sea, and his mother had been dead
for twenty years, he was quite sure.
</p>

<p>
Ah, he was wrong after all!  It was only John
Solomon and Sara Helmuth talking together.  At
that he opened his eyes, caught a faint flicker of
light&mdash;and remembered.
</p>

<p>
A violent nausea swept over him, but he conquered
it, lying with clenched fists.  He recalled
what a dying man had once whispered to him
aboard the cattle boat&mdash;"I wonder what the other
place is like?"&mdash;and he repeated it over and over
in his mind, for it was a good joke.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what the other place is like!"
</p>

<p>
It was his own voice speaking, and he laughed,
a dry cackle of a laugh that struck the other voices
dead.  Where was he?
</p>

<p>
"I'll lay odds that it's hell&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Something cool touched his brow and he jerked
away sharply, every nerve in his body twinging.
Then he realized that the thing was a hand, and
heard that queer laughter of his ring out again,
though he had not meant to laugh at all.
</p>

<p>
"Best let 'im be, miss.  'E ought to be waked
by now, but 'e'll come up all right-o.  Dang it,
I don't know as I blames 'im much.  It was a
mortal bad place."
</p>

<p>
"Hello, John!"  Hammer made a great effort
and forced himself to speak.  "What are you
doing on the other side, as the spiritualists say!
Who's that devil got his hand on me?  Take
him off, darn it!"
</p>

<p>
The hand was withdrawn, and he heard Solomon
chuckle.
</p>

<p>
"'E's come through, miss, but 'e don't know it.
'Ey, you, Mr. 'Ammer!  Sit up and take a werry
good look at this 'ere devil 'o yours&mdash;beggin'
your pardon, miss."
</p>

<p>
The startled American felt himself pulled to a
sitting position, and blinked.  The flickering
light was from a fire, and he seemed to be
sitting on a cot in a tent; also, the tent looked
oddly like that of Dr. Krausz's.
</p>

<p>
That was hardly possible, of course, but John
Solomon was standing in front of him and smoking
his vile black tobacco, while it was indubitably
Sara Helmuth at his side.
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;why, what's&mdash;where&mdash;" he stammered
confusedly.  Then a cry of mortal agony broke
from him.  "Good God, don't play with me like
this!"
</p>

<p>
He tried to shut out the vision, his hands over
his eyes; as he sank back on the cot he felt other
hands on his, pulling them away, and something
warm and wet splashed on his face.
</p>

<p>
"Hammer!  Don't, please!  It's all right, really!
Hammer, dear&mdash;oh, John, can't you do something?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, miss, if you'll stand aside."
</p>

<p>
Something struck him, and he heard a cry,
then came more blows that knocked him back;
furious, he struggled up to see the girl forcing the
laughing Solomon back.
</p>

<p>
"Stop that, John!  Don't be cruel&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Say, what do you think I am&mdash;a punching-bag?"
</p>

<p>
The angry American leaped up, and instantly
Sara Helmuth was holding to his arms, half-laughing,
half-crying as she looked up at him.
Solomon chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"I thought as 'ow that'd fetch 'im about,
miss!  Sit down, sit down, Mr. 'Ammer.  It's
only John Solomon, a-'itting of you flat-'anded.
Sit down, sir."
</p>

<p>
Hammer obeyed, utterly bewildered, still holding
the girl's hands.  The hysterical seizure passed and
and left him very weak.
</p>

<p>
"Then I'm not dead, Sara?"
</p>

<p>
"Not as anybody knows on, sir," returned
Solomon cheerfully, and his voice changed suddenly.
"Miss, leave us alone for a minute, if you please."
</p>

<p>
Obediently, the girl rose, and stepped outside
the tent, Hammer looking after in terror lest it
was all a dream.  Solomon came and sat beside
him, gripping his hand.
</p>

<p>
"'Ere, buck up, sir!  I'm sorry there ain't
a drop o' liquor, but there ain't.  Now you brace
up ship-shape and proper, Mr. 'Ammer&mdash;you 'ear
me?  Buck up, I say!  You ain't 'urt and you
ain't dead, and if I punches you one in the eye
you'll know it.  Beggin' your pardon, sir, but
don't be a&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And there came a flood of low-pitched but biting
words that effected their purpose.  Hammer forced
control over himself with a shudder and gripped
back at Solomon's hand.
</p>

<p>
"'I'm all right, John," he said shakily.  "But&mdash;but
it's hard&mdash;to realize.  Call Sara, will you?"
</p>

<p>
She must have been listening, for she was at
his side immediately, and when he had her hands
in his again it seemed to Hammer that all was
right with the world.
</p>

<p>
"Now tell me about it," he said, his flagging
interest reviving before the wonder of it all.
"Didn't the&mdash;the adders&mdash;puff-adders, Krausz said
they were&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, they didn't," broke in John.  "They
didn't, 'cause why, they wasn't nothing of the
sort, sir.  I dessay the doctor thought as 'ow
they was puff-adders, and for the matter o' that
so did I till I got down and 'ad a good look at
'em as I was a-slipping of the rope on you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott!"  exclaimed Hammer sharply.
"Do you mean to say you went down in there
after me?  And you thought they were adders&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Lud!"  And for the first and last time in his
life Hammer saw John Solomon blush in the
firelight.  "Don't take on so, Mr. 'Ammer&mdash;you see,
the Arabs wouldn't do it, so it was werry plain
it 'ad to be done, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The American put out a hand, his voice husky.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, John," he said simply.  "I&mdash;I
think you understand."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  And now if you'll be letting me
tell my story, sir&mdash;well, it was like this.  I got
there too late, what wi' losing some o' me men
and one thing and another, and the doctor 'e
was a-looking down the 'ole, so I knowed where
you was.  It fair druv me mad for a bit, sir, and
I ups and lets drive.  Werry sorry I am to say
it, but I missed, not 'aving used a gun for a long
time.
</p>

<p>
"'Owsoever, we potted three o' them danged
<i>askaris</i>, the fourth bein' me own man, but the
doctor's got clean off.  It give me quite a turn,
Mr. 'Ammer, it did that, when I come to the
edge o' that there 'ole and looked down.
The two Afghans was after the doctor, and the
Arabs wouldn't go down, so I 'ad to.
</p>

<p>
"We got the missus up first-off, but when I
went down again for you, sir, it near give me the
jumps to see you a laying across Jenson's body&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What!" broke in Hammer.  "Jenson dead?
I thought you said they weren't&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"So I did, sir; so I did; and quite right they
weren't.  Near as we could figure it out, sir,
Jenson died o' fright, and a good job, I says.
So we got you up, and wi' that I went for the doctor
and druv him clean into the jungle, I was that
worked up.  Werry sorry I am to say it, but where
'e is I don't know, and what's more, I don't
care.  We made a good job o' them <i>askaris</i>, though,
and took two o' them Dutchmen alive.  So there
you be, Mr. 'Ammer, all ship-shape and proper."  Silence
settled inside the tent, broken only by
the choking bubble of Solomon's ancient pipe.
Hammer realized that it had all taken place that
afternoon, and this was evening; but the snakes
were not deadly after all&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I made a blessed fool of myself, then!"  He
looked up and caught his words, wondering if
they knew, by any chance.  Well, since the girl
had been unconscious and Jenson dead, they
didn't.  "However, no matter about&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Hammer, it does matter."  Sara spoke
gravely, her eyes glistening.  "You see, after
we brought you here you were out of your head,
like you were back there at the plantation, and
you went over and over that horrible scene&mdash;oh,
Hammer dear!"  There was a catch in her voice.
"Didn't&mdash;didn't I tell you once upon a time that
when the great moment came&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't, Sara!" begged Hammer earnestly, trying
to smile and failing dismally.  "Yes, you were
right, and it doesn't matter whether I made a
fool of myself or not.  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Beggin' your pardon, sir and miss," broke in
Solomon hastily, as he rose, "I'd better see as
them Arabs put out a guard in case&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But neither of them heard him, for they were
looking into each other's eyes, and Hammer
suddenly found that words would not come to him.
</p>

<p>
"Sara, I&mdash;I'm afraid&mdash;I love you."
</p>

<p>
He dared not move, for he had blurted the words
out before he thought, and now fear nestled in
his heart.  Then a soft hand touched the red
whip-wale on his cheek, and&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hammer, dear, I&mdash;I'm glad, I love you!"
</p>

<p>
But, as John Solomon remarked to the Southern
Cross&mdash;having forgotten what he went out to do&mdash;"Dang
it!  'Uman nature is 'uman nature, I says.
If so be as a man 'as a 'eart like gold there ain't
no woman too good for 'im, as the old gent said
to the actress lady."
</p>

<p>
Which, taking it by and large, may be accepted
as a true statement of fact.
</p>

<p>
Now, it is commonly said of novelists and magazines
that a man in the first transports of requited
love feels forgiveness for all his enemies; nay,
the hero, in the magnanimity caused by owning
the earth and the seven heavens, all too frequently
sends his deadliest foe packing with the confident
trust that he, the foe, will go and sin no more.
</p>

<p>
That makes good Sabbath-day reading, but
it makes nothing else.  A man strong enough to
have a great enemy may be strong enough to forgive
that enemy, but it is much more likely that he
is not, has no desire to be, and would not if he
could.
</p>

<p>
Cyrus Hammer expressed himself to this effect
at breakfast the next morning.  Sara Helmuth was
still sleeping, and he and Solomon, with Omar
and the two Afghans, discussed the probable
future of Dr. Sigurd Krausz, archaeologist.
</p>

<p>
"He's dangerous," declared Hammer with decision.
"I'd say, send out all the men after him,
John, and if he comes willingly, then all right.
If not, fetch him, anyway.  The poor devil must
be in bad shape, what with that nose of his; but
after yesterday I'll be blessed if I'm not set on
giving him the limit!"
</p>

<p>
Solomon looked at the Afghans.  Akhbar Khan
exchanged glances with his cousin, and the two
men rose, bowed in a silent salaam, and stalked
off with their rifles under their arms.
</p>

<p>
Solomon looked at Omar, and the Arab's teeth
flashed out as he followed.  And so, for the present,
Hammer forgot his enemy, for Sara Helmuth had
emerged from the other tent and now joined them.
</p>

<p>
"There's summat as Mr. 'Ammer don't know
about yet," remarked Solomon complacently as
the girl sipped her coffee, and she flashed a smile
at him.  Save for the circles about her eyes, sleep
had removed all traces of her weariness.  "When
so be as you're ready, miss, we might 'ave a look
at it."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," she nodded, then her eyes steadied.
"But first, John, I want it thoroughly understood
that I waive all claim to it.  By right it belongs to
you and to Hammer&mdash;by right of suffering and toil
and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What is it you're talking about?" demanded
the American, frowning.
</p>

<p>
"The treasure," she said, and explained.  As
she had rightly told Krausz, that part of the treasure
which contained the papers, relics, and gifts from
the Viceroy to the King of Portugal, had been placed
in the pit of snakes, and in all likelihood would
have remained there had not Solomon been forced
to descend, and so discovered that the snakes were
harmless.
</p>

<p>
It had been hauled out and left amid the ruins.
The more intrinsically valuable portions of the
treasure were buried underground in another
place, but the girl had by now given up all hopes
of ever getting it.
</p>

<p>
"We know where it is," she concluded with a
shiver, "but it would take time, and I wouldn't
stay here a minute longer than necessary, money
or no money.  You and John, Hammer, can divide&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hold on there!" exclaimed the American.
"I'm not in on this treasure stunt.  It belongs to
you, Sara&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Just a minute sir and miss," and Solomon leaned
forward earnestly, waving his empty pipe as he
spoke.  "O' course, I 'as to go back wi' you to
Mombasa and straighten up this 'ere mess wi' the
governor; but if so as you don't want to wait,
I'll come back and dig up the stuff on me own.  I'll
chance it if you will, miss; and you Mr. 'Ammer
to take what there is 'ere, me to take what's left."
</p>

<p>
"That's fair enough, Sara," put in Hammer
quickly.  "Only, I've no right to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You have!" cried the girl indignantly.  "The
idea&mdash;after all you've gone through for me!  Well,
let's have it as John proposes, then; you and I,
Hammer, take the papers and relics, and John can
take the gold for his share.  If you don't say yes,
I'll&mdash;I'll give the whole business to Potbelly!"
</p>

<p>
"All right," laughed the American, who, to
tell the truth, had no great faith in the entire treasure
story.  "All ready?"
</p>

<p>
As only two of the Arabs had remained in camp,
Solomon summoned them with axes, and the five
started for the ruins.  Hammer could not enter the
tangle of jungle without a shudder, and would
greatly have preferred staying away altogether;
but once in for it he patted the revolver given him by
Solomon and determined to see the thing through.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for his peace of mind it appeared
that Solomon had left the treasure in one of the clear
spaces of the fort itself, for which Hammer was
devoutly thankful; he sorely doubted his ability
to visit that pit again, for his nerves were still
badly shaken.
</p>

<p>
They reached the clearing, and in spite of his
scepticism, Hammer felt a thrill at sight of the
two coffin-like lead cases that lay beside the
bush-strewn ruins of a wall.  Without delay the two Arabs
fell to work with their axes, ripping open one of the
cases; and after half an hour's labour a second case,
of heavy wood, was laid out.
</p>

<p>
"Teak," grunted Solomon.  "Give that ax 'ere."
</p>

<p>
With some care he attacked the locks that rimmed
the iron-bound case, smashing them one after
another.  When the last had gone he paused, and
beckoned Sara forward.
</p>

<p>
"Open it, miss."
</p>

<p>
The girl obeyed eagerly.  Stooping over, she
managed to raise and tip back the heavy top, and
with it a mass of camphor-smelling cloth that had
lain beneath.  A gleam of yellow shot up, and
Hammer found himself staring down at a magnificent
gold-wrought reliquary.  One of the Arabs gave an
exclamation in Kiswahili.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Thahabu</i>!  Gold!"
</p>

<p>
At the same instant Hammer's eyes darted up to
the bush-strewn wall.  The others had heard nothing,
absorbed in the sight of the treasure, but Hammer
caught a dull tan-hued form amid the bushes, and
snatched at his revolver.  He perceived a glint of
steel, and fired through his coat pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Yess, it iss gold," came a mumble, piercing
through the startled cry of Sara, and the misshapen
face of Sigurd Krausz rose amid the bushes.
</p>

<p>
A tongue of flame spat back at Hammer, who
tried to fire again but could not.  Slowly, yet
before the echoes of Krausz's shot had flung back
from the jungle around, the American slipped and
went to his knees.
</p>

<p>
He looked up in surprise at Sara Helmuth;
then, as her fingers went out to his, he choked and
fell sideways, both hands clutching at his throat.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br /><br />
THE "DAPHNE" AGAIN
</h3>

<p>
"Er&mdash;'pon my word, Mr. Hammer, I'm&mdash;er&mdash;glad
to be able to apologize!"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, commissioner!  Then it's all right
with Nairobi?"
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly, my dear chap, perfectly!  Had a
bit of a ragging from the Germans, but Krausz
had misrepresented things fearfully, you know,
and that <i>askari</i> business&mdash;er&mdash;put the governor in a
perfectly beastly rage, I'm told.  He gave 'em
the man's body with his compliments.  Ripping
morning, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't be better," grinned Hammer cheerfully.
He was sitting in a deck-chair beneath
the <i>Daphne's</i> awning, Sara Helmuth on one side
and Commissioner Smith on the other.  His
throat was swathed in bandages, and he had lost
his healthy tan, but he was undeniably happy,
and showed it.
</p>

<p>
"That yarn&mdash;er&mdash;reminded me of your American
tales," went on Smith rather heavily, as the
figure of Solomon appeared coming to join the
group.  "Two bad men, don't you know&mdash;er&mdash;shooting
across a bar, and all that kind of thing.
Each one plugs the other&mdash;er&mdash;double funeral.
Rather exciting thing out here, though, 'pon my
word!  Very usual in America, I understand."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, very," returned Hammer gravely.
"Hello, John!  Can I smoke yet?"
</p>

<p>
"Werry sorry, sir, but against orders.  Your
servant, Mr. Smith and I 'opes as you're quite
well?"
</p>

<p>
The Commissioner flushed slightly as he shook
hands.
</p>

<p>
"Quite, thanks, very much.  Er&mdash;narrow escape
Mr. Hammer had, by Jove!"
</p>

<p>
"Quite so, sir.  Missed the jugular by a matter
of 'airbreadths, the doctor said.  Prowidence is a
werry mysterious thing, sir, as the old gent said
when the 'ousemaid saw a mouse."
</p>

<p>
"We might show Mr. Smith that reliquary,
John," smiled Sara Helmuth, and her hand stole
quite shamelessly over the arm of the deck-chair
to Hammer's.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Daphne</i> lay anchored off Melindi.  The
commissioner's launch lay at the ladder, its crew
of two spruce policemen chatting in Kiswahili
with the Arabs above, while the oily ground-swell
lifted the yacht at her anchor.
</p>

<p>
It was two weeks since Hammer had left the
jungle behind for ever, as he devoutly hoped, and
with the commissioner's visit the last weight had
been lifted from his mind.
</p>

<p>
Not only had he been entirely absolved from
any complicity in Harcourt's death, but Nairobi
had been graciously pleased to overlook entirely
the death of Dr. Krausz, and to waive all claims
to the treasure in hand&mdash;after the cathedral at
Mombasa had been presented with the relics.
</p>

<p>
Hammer had little use for relics, but he had
been very careful to say nothing about the
reliquaries.  Of these, the finest was that containing
the reputed hand of St. Thomas&mdash;indeed, Commissioner
Smith declared it, rather vaguely, to be
"perfectly ripping&mdash;top hole, don't you know,
in such things!"
</p>

<p>
His judgement proved ultimately to be entirely
correct, while the records, historical and
otherwise, contained in the cases, were declared by
Sara Helmuth to be worth a good round sum to
any library in Europe.
</p>

<p>
As Hammer was not particularly imbued with
a love for art, he sold the three smaller reliquaries
to Solomon; and also agreed to carry that individual
back to Port Said on the yacht.
</p>

<p>
As Solomon said, the gold had waited two
hundred years, and it could wait another few
months very well, while he had important business
at Port Said.  A crew of sorts had been shipped at
Mombasa, and with Hammer's recovery the voyage
home would begin.
</p>

<p>
"You'd better stick around, commissioner,"
smiled the American as his visitor rose.  "About
a week from now the American Consul is coming
up from Mombasa, and there's going to be some
doings, as we say in America."
</p>

<p>
"Eh?"  Mr. Smith looked blank for a moment,
until Sara Helmuth's blushes proclaimed themselves.
Whereupon, being a very observant young
man, his face brightened up, and he seized the
American's hand.
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;by Jove, old chap&mdash;I congratulate you
both, 'pon my word I do!  I say, do let me bring
my assistant and the lieutenant, eh what?"
</p>

<p>
"Bring your whole constabulary force," grinned
Hammer, "and we'll do the thing up in style!
And come out for dinner Sunday night, Smith."
</p>

<p>
Quite excited, the commissioner departed.  Hand
in hand, Hammer and Sara Helmuth watched his
launch puff away toward the green-hilled shore,
until Solomon cleared his throat nosily, and they
saw two Arabs approaching bearing a bulky
package.
</p>

<p>
"Beggin' your pardon, sir and miss," announced
Solomon, "but this 'ere's a bit o' summat as
aren't to be shown at the weddin', so to speak.
If I may make so bold, miss, as to be a giving
of a weddin' present before the 'appy moment&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A cry of delight broke from the girl, for as the
package fell apart there was displayed that same
fawn-coloured rug, with the blue, white, and gold
dragon of five claws, which Hammer had seen
when first he wakened in Solomon's house.
</p>

<p>
"It's a rug as you might not care for, first-off,"
explained Solomon apologetically, "but it ain't
to be bought for money, miss.  Where I got it
I 'adn't ought to say, but it 'ad best be kept under
cover till you get out o' these 'ere waters.  That's
the imperial dragon o' China, Mr. 'Ammer, and
rugs like them ain't made for sale&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's beautiful!" cried the delighted Sara,
Hammer nodding with appreciative eyes, for he
knew that John Solomon's words were strictly
true.
</p>

<p>
As he looked about, however, he saw the pudgy
little man bending over his little red notebook,
writing very carefully with his fountain pen, and
forbore to interrupt.
</p>

<p>
"Are you glad, girl?" he turned to Sara very
soberly, motioning the Arabs to take away the
rug as he did so.
</p>

<p>
"Hammer, dear," she whispered, "I'm happy!"
</p>

<p>
His face had lost the old lines of hardness
and bitterness, and as he met her eyes and smiled
into them with perfect understanding, he
remembered something.
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;my name isn't Hammer, dear!  You'll
have to be Mrs. Cyrus Murray&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but you'll be just Hammer, to me!"
</p>

<p>
"There!" and Solomon clapped his notebook
shut with a very complacent air.  "I'd been and
overlooked that 'ere account wi' Dr. Krausz;
but it's all ship-shape and proper now to file
away and 'ave done with."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, your account!" laughed the American.
"That's the one you presented to him, eh?  Do
you always keep your accounts, John?"
</p>

<p>
"Werry good plan, sir.  They come in 'andy,
like, mortal often, even if they're filed away.
Howsoever, sir and miss, business is all werry
well in its place, but its place ain't between two
young 'earts, I says&mdash;and since this 'ere account
is closed, I'll just file it away."
</p>

<p>
And as he shuffled off in his carpet-slippers
toward his own cabin, the two who sat side by
side gazed after him for a moment, smiling, and
then turned to each other.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
